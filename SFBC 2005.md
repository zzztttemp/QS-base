## SCHEDULE 3

### FORM OF WARRANTY TO BE GIVEN BY THE NOMINATED SUPPLIER TO THE EMPLOYER IN CONSIDERATION OF NOMINATION

  

This **DEED OF WARRANTY** is granted to ……….. (”the Employer”) in respect of ………. (”the Main Contract Works”) which are to be carried out by ………. (”the Contractor”) under the terms of the Contract between the Employer and the Contractor dated ………. Or the letter of acceptance dated ………. Of the Contractor’s tender dated ……….* and in respect of our Tender for ………. The Supply Contract materials, goods, equipment and other things (”the Goods”) which are intended to be incorporated in the Main Contract Works under a Nominated Supply Contract (”the Supply Contract”).

We ………. (”the Nominated Supplier”) warrant that in consideration of your instructing the Architect to nominate us as the Nominated Supplier for Goods:-

- (a) We will commence and complete the delivery of the Goods and perform all the services specified, in accordance with the terms of the Supply Contract.
- (b) We will indemnify the Employer against all extra costs that may be incurred by non-performance of the Supply Contract, by late delivery of the Goods or by any breach of these warranties.
- (c) We have exercised and will exercise all reasonable skill and care in :-
    - (i) the design of the Goods insofar as the Goods have been or will be design by us; and
    - (ii) the selection of materials and goods for the Supply Contract insofar as such materials and goods have been or will be selected by us.
- (d) We will comply with and satisfy any performance specification or requirements insofar as such performance specification or requirements are included or referred to in the Tender Documents and/or our Tender as part of the description of the Supply Contract.
- (e) We will supply the Architect and/or Contractor with such information as either may reasonably require and at such times that the Contractor shall not be delayed in completing the Main Contract Works by the Completion Date by our failure to supply such information or by delay on our part, provided always that no liability shall arise in respect of such delay on our part until we have accepted the Contractor’s order in respect of the Supply Contract.
- (f) Nothing in our Tender shall operate to exclude or limit our liability for breach of the warranties set out herein.
- (g) We will obtain a surety bond in the form set out in Schedule 1 of the Supply Contract with the requisite changes in wording to reflect that the bond is to be given by the Nominated Supplier to the Employer instead of to the Contractor. This bond will be duly executed under seal by an approved insurance company or bank, acknowledging that the insurance company or the bank is jointly and severally bound with us to the Employer in the sum of 10% of the Supply Contract Sum (round up the nearest thousand dollars) against breach of the warranties hereof.

The words and expressions used in the Deed of Warranty shall have the same meaning as in the Contract and the Supply Contract.
