#Estimate 
## Questions

In this Final Assessment, the Candidate is assumed to be working in a private consulting QS firm and is the project surveyor on a residential development throughout the feasibility stage to the completion of the building contract.

A client wishes to redevelop a site into a high-class residential furnished apartment building He wishes his building to be a landmark of the district as he wants to keep it for long-term investment.

However, the site is of triangular shape and the harbour view will be blocked by the adjacent buildings, which are about 10-storey high.

The Architect has come up with a design for the proposed development and the client is quite happy with it. The proposed design is for a building consisting of a two-storey commercial/carpark podium and a 30-storey tower block. The storey height of the commercial/carpark floor is 4.50 m and the residential tower is 3.50 m. The building is of curved facade and will be much taller than the adjacent buildings. This enables most of the flat units to capture a good harbour view.

However, when the QS presents the preliminary cost plan of the proposed development to the client for his approval, he is shocked by the much higher than expected cost estimate.

1. Because of the high estimated cost, the client is not happy and queried that the cost is not comparable to the current market cost for other residential development. The QS is asked by the client to explain the reason and reconcile the difference. The QS is also asked by the Architect to suggest ways to reduce the cost down to a more reasonable level.

## 20250323

- Reason and reconcile the difference
	- High class quality
		- Higher IFO cost
		- Might have more areas for clubhouse at high cost per CFA
	- Triangular site
		- Irregular shape building might have higher wall to floor ratio, increase cost for partition walls and wall finishes
		- Site might be congested and hard for storage and mobility, which increases the construction cost
	- High rise composite development
		- Podium design might involve transitional plate, which uses higher steel ratio than normal slab and increases the cost
		- Podium design might involve extra roof works and landscape works
		- High floor levels impose more loading requirements on foundation design. The quantity of concrete and reinforcement is higher for foundation
		- High-rise building requires refugee floor, and more design requirements on E&M works e.g. to pump water to higher levels
		- Storey height for residential part is higher than normal building increasing the cost for concrete works and wall finishes
	- Curved facade
		- Curved facade might need to be precast, increasing the cost
- Reduce the cost down
	- Decrease the storey height for residential building from 3.5 m to 3 m 
	- Change the curved facade to straight one
	- Reduce the building height and floor levels

## Assessor Notes

- Reconciliation with ordinary residential building
	- It is a furnished apartment while an ordinary residential building has no FFE cost
	- Higher M&E services cost especially with HVAC provision
	- Mechanical carparking system is expensive for normal residential building
	- Higher storey to storey height for typical floors i.e. higher cost for vertical elements
	- Curved facade
	- Curtain walling for residential tower and a large portion of podium with granite cladding
	- Transfer plate structure
	- Higher standard of finishing
	- Foundation and substructure cost higher than normal
	- Small site but a tall building, inefficient design
	- Higher proportion for preliminaries cost and contingency sum
- Cost saving without downgrading
	- Straight facade in lieu of curbed
	- Window A/C units or split unit in lieu of package unit system
	- Lower storey to storey height
	- Delete mechanical carparking system
	- Omit transfer plate
	- Use cheaper finishing material
	- Use window wall system or even change back to normal window and wall
	- Advise the client to put FFE into separate budget e.g. operational expense
- Updated cost plan
	- It is not possible to reduce the cost down to the client's budget of xxx/m 2 but should be able to achieve a unit cost of around xxx/m 2

#TenderAnalysis 
## Questions

2. Tenders have been returned and the QS is requested to check the submitted tenders and report on the qualifications of the tenders.

## Assessor Notes

- Identify question
	- Letter / report to client commenting on qualification of tenders and make recommendation
		- Identify what is qualification or not
		- If qualification, not conforming, implication (lower tender sum), ask tenderer to withdraw
		- If not, ask to clarify, implication (saving), cannot object
		- Option A&B to client for his decision
	- Letter to tenderers asking for clarification and withdrawal of qualifications
- Key
	- Identify qualification and mere alternative proposal for client's consideration
	- For private job, should not recommend DQ and leave to client's decision
- Answer
	- Tender A
		- Both the reduction in the amount of LD and limiting the total amount of LD are qualifications to the tender. These qualifications would have reduced the tenderer's risk and therefore they would be able to offer a lower tender price. The tenderer should be asked to withdraw these qualifications and abide by the tender sum or they might be asked to submit a confirming tender in addition to their original tender for client's consideration.
		- The tenderer's statement for using Z Construction Co as their sub-contractor for most of the works is not a qualification to the tender. The tender should be asked to clarify the extent of works to be sublet to this sub-contractor and the technical ability of the sub-contractor. Under the contract, the Architect cannot object the subletting of the works unless expressly prohibited by the Architect.
	- Tender B
		- Submitting a tender with a longer contract period than that specified is a qualification and is not a conforming tender. The tenderer however has submitted a conforming tender with an extra cost of 1.8 M which is even higher than the amount of LD times the extra 30 days (i.e. 1.5 M). This implies that the tenderer has allowed more than enough to allow for the contract to be delayed by 30 days. The tenderer should be asked to clarify the work programme and confirm that 530 days is a realistic contract period. For tender comparison purpose, the higher tender sum should be used.
	- Tender C
		- The proposal to add a sub-contractor into the approved tender list for E&M installation works is not a qualification to the tender. They are not saying that they are going to use this sub-contractor even though it is most likely. The architect should write to refuse this proposal and insist the original list be followed.
	- Tender D
		- The tender's proposal to replace the bathtubs by shower basin is not a qualification to the tender. The tenderer should be asked to clarify if their tender is based on the use of bathtubs or shower basin. They should still be based on the bathtubs scheme otherwise they cannot offer further saving if alternative scheme is adopted.
		- It is advisable to obtain further information from the tenderer on their proposal and if possible to agree some rates for the purpose of valuation of future variations. The candidate may need to advise the client on the validity of this proposal of the possible saving if any.
	- Tender E
		- The telephone call to the client about the arithmetical error after the tenders had been opened is not in accordance with the tender conditions. However, if it is really true, this tender will become the lowest tender and taking into account the qualification on the LD by tenderer A, this tender is more attractive to the client. The candidate should advise the client on both conditions and seek the client instruction on whether this tender is to be considered further.

## Questions

3. The client has accepted the Architect's recommendation to award the contract to the lowest tender. The client asks the Architect to draft the letter of intent for issuance to the contractor. However, there are still some qualifications that need to be resolved, one of them is concerning assignment/subletting of the contract. The QS is asked to give advice on the question of the validity of a letter of intent and the difference between assignment and subletting.
## Assessor Notes

- A Letter of Intent should be issued to the Contractor which is legally binding to both parties
- Fundamental elements of a Letter of Intent: - 
	- Express intention of the client to award the contract to the contractor
	- Essential terms must be specified e.g. contract sum, contract period, conditions of contract, acceptance of qualifications, post tender correspondence and agreement, terms of payment, etc.
	- Certainty - the terms must be reasonably certain
	- Consideration - ie. Contract sum or means of reimbursement should be specified
- As the Architect said, there were contractual qualifications that had not yet been resolved, the Letter of Intent should try to address this point.
- Reference to "subject to contract" is not appropriate. The candidate should advise the Architect to identify those items not yet resolved and set out clearly the difference in agreement to avoid an open-end contract.
- Effect
	- The Architect can instruct the Contractor to start work based on the Letter of Intent as there is already a contract between both parties.
	- The financial risk to both parties will be confined to payment on quantum merit basis if no specific terms had been agreed.
	- If formal contract document cannot be agreed on time and the contractor wants to submit an interim payment application, he can do so based on the original tender submission or on quantum merit basis depending on the terms specified in the Letter of Intent.
- Assignment & Sub-letting
	- Assignment is the transfer of rights and duties to another party
	- Sub-letting is where an independent contract carries out works for or provides a service to the Main Contractor while the Main Contractor retains the full responsibility for the sub-contract works or services.
	- For this particular case where most of the works would be carried out by a single sub-contractor is definitely not an assignment.

#Determination #SA
## Questions

4. Three months after the commencement of the contract, the client wishes to convert the building into a hotel due to the recent relaxation in plot ratio for hotel development. The client has asked the Architect to issue a stop work instruction. The Architect asked the QS to advise him on the contractual and financial implications to the contract on the suspension of works.

## Methodology

- Contractual and financial implication
	- Heading of claim if & if not determine
- Propose alternative solution with details

## Assessor Notes

- When the Architect issued a stop work instruction, the Contractor is entitled to claim for EOT as well as reimbursement of L&E
- The Contract normally allows for a maximum period of three months and the Contractor cannot determine the contract due to the suspension
- However if the suspension of works continues for more than three months, the Contractor can terminate the contract under GCC
- If the suspension is likely to be more than six months, the Contractor definitely has the right to determine the contract and make the following monetary claim to the Employer: - 
	- Value of all works completed
	- Cost of demobilisation of labour and plant
	- Cost of redundant materials
	- Monetary claim from his DSC / NSC
	- Loss of office overhead
	- Loss of anticipated profit from this contract 
- Alternatively the Contractor may choose not to determine the contract but claim for the EOT and other monetary claims including: - 
	- Idling cost of labour and plant
	- Extra preliminaries cost
	- Inflation in cost of labour and material
	- Extra finance charge to the contract
	- Extra office overhead
	- Demobilisation and re-mobilisation of labour and plant
	- Claim from NSC / DSC
	- But not loss of profit
- If the Contractor chooses to carry on the contract, it is advisable for the client to enter into a supplementary agreement with the Contractor which should include the following key terms and conditions: -
	- Revised contract completion date
	- Agreed lump sum settlement for all claims due to the suspension
	- Method of agreeing rates for valuation of new works items
	- Any supplementary specification to be incorporated for the hotel building
	- List of new NSC / NS
	- List of additional provisional sums
	- Adjustment to contingency sum
	- If possible, a supplementary BQ be produced and priced by the contractor to arrive at a revised contract sum
	- Any sectional completion of the works for soft opening of the hotel
	- Any bonus or incentive payment for acceleration of programme to catch up the delay

#Defect
## Questions

5. After the completion of the contract, there were a lot of defective works and the QS is asked by the Architect to advise him on the right of the client to employ others to carry out the remedial works and deduct the cost from the final account.

## Assessor Notes

- Defect of stainless steel railing
	- It is no doubt that it is a defect. The Contractor agreed to replace it but the client did not allow him to carry out the replacement work until the closure of the swimming pool. The client is not in a very strong ground not to allow the contractor to carry out the replacement work within a reasonable time. The sub-standard railing has not stopped the client from using the swimming pool for the past year during the defects liability period and also for the next few years. Therefore, it is not fair for the client to insist to deduct the full amount of the cost of these railing. The candidate should advise the Architect to recommend the client to deduct part of the total cost and have the railing be replaced five years later as a compromised solution.
- Defect of window leakage
	- The candidate should rely on the Architect's judgment that the defect is the contractor's responsibility. Therefore the contractor's proposal to limit their liability after they had completed the recaulking of the window is not acceptable. The Contractor should still be responsible for the defective windows if they were still defective after recaulking. However, the client's intention to claim loss of profit is too remote and is not contractually enforceable.
- Defect of sanitary fittings
	- It seems that the Contractor is in a stronger position to argue that it is not their liability for the defects. The candidate should recommend the Architect to seek an independent test laboratory to verify the result of the test and check with the manufacturer's technical data of the fittings. The defect may be due to the Contractor's wrong method of cleaning before handover of the completed building. The discovery of the defect after the defects liability period should not be the reason for the Contractor to be free from liability for latent defects. However the client should not start replacing the sanitary fittings and deducting the cost from the Contractor without resolving the liability of the defect.
- Minor defect
	- Slow progress is not a good reason or sufficient ground for the client to employ another contractor to carry out the outstanding remedial works. The Architect should give his opinion and specify a reasonable time that the Contractor should have completed the remedial works and serve a note to that effect before the client can employ another contractor for the remedial works. It is also advisable for the client to seek a few quotations for the works in order to select a competitive price otherwise the Contractor may challenge the cost to be deducted from him.
	- The retention money is not specifically for the purposes of retaining money from the Contractor for rectifying outstanding defects. However the client is not contractually right to withhold any money due to the Contractor at his own will. The client should honour any certificate issued by the Architect for payment purpose.
	- It is sometimes difficult to resolve all defects after the completion of the contract and expiry of the defects liability period. It is prudent to advise the Architect and the client to take a practical and reasonable approach in cases where it might be difficult to identify the responsibility of the defects or difficult to rectify those defects not of major issue. Monetary rebate by the Contractor for unsatisfactory or sub-standard works is always a compromise solution. Of course for serious defects e.g. water leakage, have to be made good by the Contractor.

#Estimate 
## Assessor Notes

- Objectives
	- To prepare a preliminary cost estimate for an I/O building by adjusting the final contract sums of an existing building with the application of Tender Price Indices, making other amendments for changes in specification, and other supplementary information or assumptions; or
	- To carry out a preliminary cost estimate by other appropriate method based on the information available and other assumptions
	- To compare and comment on the unit costs between the new and existing building and explain the differences
	- To suggest whether the provision of fan coil units and ceiling tiles is financially viable by comparing the expected costs and expected revenues. (cost benefit analysis)
- Time adjustment
	- The estimate should either be adjusted to the programmed start date of each package using forecast indices or to a base date of September 1997 stating future fluctuation as an exclusion
- Site Investigation
	- The final contract value is adjusted by using the building footprint area or construction floor area and changes of the TPI over time
- Caisson Foundation
	- Although caisson foundations are not allowed for in the new project, the adjustment to the final contract sum of the caisson foundations can be used as a reasonable allowance of foundation costs. It would be reasonable to assume that the cost of bored pile foundations are generally in line with those of the caisson foundations
	- Alternatively, the candidate may demonstrate other estimating techniques such as the CFA to be supported by a unit cross sectional areas of foundation, etc.
- Main Contract
	- Apportion the final contract sum of the existing building into "building" and "building services" at a rato of between 70/30 and 80/20, and then adjust for changes in the corresponding TPI over time.
	- Adjust the new CFA
	- Allow for the cost of basement construction such as
		- Excavation and disposal
		- Temporary soil support, shoring and strutting to perimeter
		- Dewatering
		- Permanent basement walls
	- Adjust the costs of external walls for the new building envelope
	- Allow the cost of footbridge construction
- External Landscaping
	- Although there is not indication of an external site area of the new building, a nominal adjustment based on TPI and / or CFA will be accepted
- Alternative methods of preparing the cost estimate
	- A preliminary estimate can also be compiled on the basis of physical dimensions, areas, no of storeys, outlines specification given together with suitable quantity factors, cost data and assumptions
- Comparison of the unit construction costs between the new and existing building and comment on the differences
	- A comparison of the unit $/m 2 (CFA) between the new and existing I/O building including identification and explanation of significant factors which give rise to additional costs are expected. Since different assumptions might have been made by the candidates in their estimates in respect of the costs of foundations, basement enclosure, curtain walls and allowances for contingencies, a wide range of unit costs per floor area may be arrived at, and therefore as guidelines, a total unit construction cost for the new building in the range of $10,000/m 2 to $15,000/m 2 at September 1997 is acceptable.
- Cost benefit analysis
	- The candidate is expected to carry out a financial analysis for the supply, installation and maintenance of ceiling tiles and fan coils system, in return for an additional rental of $20/m 2 per month over a period of 10 years. Certain assumptions such as cost estimates, rate of return, frequency of maintenance and replacement, obsolescence, etc are expected.
	- The analysis shall comprise
		- The capital cost of the suspended ceiling tile system, say $200/m 2 to $350/m 2
		- The crapital cost of the fan coil unit and the distribution pipework system within the tenancy area, say $300/m 2 to $500/m 2
		- Regular maintenance costs for the fan coil system, say 5% to 10% of installation costs per year
		- Regular increase in rent, say every three years
		- Calculation of the present value of all expected incomes and expenditures over time, say a discounted interest rate of 7.5% to 10%
- Conclusion and recommendation, state assumption
- Break-even point of income and expenditure should be within 5 or 6 year

#Procurement
## Assessor Notes

- In the second paragraph of the Client's letter dated 18/6/97, the Client has indicated that he is very happy with the existing design. What he is uncomfortable with is the experience he had on the previous project (on traditional BQ procurement) in negotiating variations with the contractor.
- In his fax of 19/6/97, the Architect (the one, already employed on the project) advised that final design was expected to be ready by early July.
- In the memo dated 19/6/97 received from A. Partner, the candidate was asked to contact other project team members to gather more information about the current status of the project. In his answer, the candidate is expected to come back with replies from the structural engineer and / or building services engineer, presumably supporting the Architect's statement that the design is at a very advance stage.
- Given that the drawings "ready for measurement" will soon be available, and bearing in mind the time it will take to start all over with a new design, the D&B arrangement does not seem at all attractive
- By referring to the difficulties in agreeing variations under the traditional BQ arrangement, the client is apparently misguided by the general saying that D&B is more superior in terms of "financial certainty". However, this is only the case when the Brief is very clear and specific about the Client's requirements, and when it is unlikely that there are major variations after award of tender. The candidate is expected to clarify this general misconception in his reply.
- The following should also be taken into account:
	- Abortive work carried out by the existing Architect (and other Consultants), if the D&B option is adopted
	- Viability of terminating the existing consultancy agreements and employing a new team on the same project
	- Technical competencies of the "new" contractor and the "new" architect. With regard to the former, what is his experience in dealing with design, although his performance on the previous contract as contractor was satisfactory? With regard to the latter, has the architect designed I/O buildings previously? What is his track record of performance?
- The candidate is expected to make certain assumptions regarding the existing time and cost commitments, and compare them with the D&B option.
- Recommendations
	- A sensible recommendation is that D&B would not be a favourable procurement method under the given situation. Any conclusion to be drawn should be based on an overall analysis of the pros and cons of various factors as discussed above. Although business relationship and interest of various parties are important considerations, professional requirements and consideration should not be comprised.

#LossExpense
## Assessor Notes

- Objectives
	- To assess the validity of a contractual claim relating to liability for information furnished to the tenderer at the time of tender
	- To assess the direct and indirect financial implications of a contractual claim
- Validity of the claim
	- Analysis
		- The candidate should be aware of the contractual implications of the preliminaries clauses which put the burden of the design of the temporary works to the contractor
		- However, the tenderer's indication during tender interview that they would follow the RSE's design dur to the tight construction programme and the RSE's failure to inform the contractor of subsequent extra requirements from the Buildings Department has complicated the case further
		- As the RSE could not foresee such extra requirements being imposed by the Buildings Department, it would not be reasonable to expect a tenderer to make such allowance in his tender
		- Also the indication by the tenderer during tender interview that they would follow the RSE's design is not a qualification to their tender and has not changed the original contract requirement to make them fully responsible for all temporary works (if there were no such design by the RSE)
	- Recommendations
		- The contractor cannot claim that the issue of construction drawings is automatically a variation under CC. However, they may be entitled to extra time and costs by claiming that there was misrepresentation on the part of the RSE by not informing the tenderers of the extra requirement before the award of the Contract
		- Bonus: advise further on cost overrun and propose a cost saving exercise from other areas that could bring the project cost within budget
- Financial assessment
	- Direct and indirect cost
	- E.g. time related preliminary items

## Question

A developer is interested in a land auction for a site next to a new MTR station which is still under construction.

The site is currently under the control of MTRC and is being used as the working area by the MTR station contractor until the completion of the new MTR station in one year's time.

The development site is separated from the MTR station by a highway.

One of the lease conditions is that the develop has to build a transport interchange in the podium floors and hand it back to the Transport Department for management.

The developer plans to build a shopping centre in the three levels of podium and three residential tower blocks above the podium roof.

The shopping centre an the transport interchange will be connected to the new MTR station by a footbridge over the highway.

Please prepare a preliminary cost estimate for the proposed development so that the developer can put in a bid for the land auction. The estimate should be based on the information given by the Project Manager included in the appendix to this question.

## Question

The developer is successful in the land auction.

In order to save time, the developer intends to start the piling works for the new development while the site is still under the control of MTRC and the station contractor. By doing so, the developer can start the superstructure works immediately upon taking possession of the site in a year's time and thus shorten the overall project programme, save on the project finance charges and start the pre-sale of the residential units earlier.

At this stage, only the scheme design is complete and the structural engineering has managed to produce a preliminary loading plan of the development. A preliminary piling design and piling layout plan are also available.

In discussions with MTRC, they say they have no objection to the station contractor taking on the extra piling works, however MTRC require that the station contractor guarantees that the works of the station contract would not be affected and the developer undertakes to indemnify MTRC for all the expenses incurred for such additional works.

Please advise the Project Manager the best way to achieve this requirement from the developer and the important issues to be addressed or covered by any agreement to be executed.

## Assessor Notes

- Developer cannot enter into a direct contract with the existing station contractor for the piling work as the site is not yet handed over to him yet
- MTRC have no objection to the station contractor to take on the extra piling works on condition that there will be no delay to the existing contract, and the developer has to indemnify MTRC for all extra expenses incurred for such additional works
- A supplemental agreement to the existing contract is required and this agreement has to be signed by the contractor, MTRC and the developer
- The developer has to give an indemnity or guarantee to MTRC to cover the risk of any delay to the station contract and the extra payment for the additional piling works including project administration fee to be charged by MTRC
- SA to cover (similar to a new contract)
	- Scope and price of extra works
	- Overall and sectional completion of the existing contract and the additional works
	- LAD for any delay of the extra works
	- No claim provision for any interface problem between the existing contract and the additional works
	- Basis of variation to the scope of additional works and valuation of variations, if any
	- Indemnity to MTRC for taking on the additional works by the station contractor
- Neither formal agreement nor an indemnity is expected as candidates would not be expected to draft the legal / contract document. Proceed the key issues to be included in the SA and indemnity.
- Bonus if candidate can draft a fairly good agreement.

## Question

Eventually when the station contractor is ready to start the piling works (4 months afterward), the developer instructs the works to be suspended as he wishes to make application to the government to increase the GFA of the development.

It is technically feasible to add two more tower blocks on the podium roof, but the structural framing design of the transport interchange will have to be revised by changing the structural grid. The design of the transport interchange then has to be revised and resubmitted to the Transport Department for approval.

After three months and a lot of work being done for the addition of two more tower blocks, the government rejects the developer's application for the increase in GFA.

In view of the extent of the abortive works and the loss in time due to this incident, the developer decides to go back to the original scheme and to call tenders for the Main Contract as soon as possible.

At this stage, the detailed design has not yet been started. The design team needs another three months to complete the design to such a stage that proper tender documents can be prepared for competitive tender. Allowing two months for preparing bills of quantities and two months for tendering, analysis, report, and negotiation, the earliest time to appoint the Main Contractor will be seven months from now. However, the piling works will be completed in four months' time, and the site will be handed over to the developer by MTRC within one month after the completion of the piling works and the clearing of the works area by the station contractor.

The developer does not want to see the site being left vacant for two months without a Main Contractor to start the superstructure works.

Please prepare a report to the Project Manager comparing two alternative tendering methods to achieve the developer's requirement while giving the developer the highest degree of tender competition.

## Assessor Notes

- Methodology
	- Recommend appropriate tendering method
		- Open tendering or selective tendering (better)
		- BQ or other method -> BQ w provisional qty / SOR with ref qty / Rate Schedule
		- Contract type -> DB / management contracting / construction management / cost plus
	- Consideration factor
		- Pre-contract
			- Time, design process, cost competitiveness
		- Post-contract
			- Work involvement, work progress, time of construction and cost implication
- Fit the programme (5 months before develop takes over the site)
	- Detailed design of the superstructure has not been started
	- 3 months for design to be ready for the preparation of tender document
	- 2 months for prepartion of BQ
		- Not time suitable
	- 2 months for tendering process to select a contractor

## Question

The Main Contract was awarded based on the condition that the site would be handed over to the Main Contractor in two parts in order to allow early commencement of superstructure works. The second part of the site is scheduled to be available two months after the first part of the site is handed over to the Main Contractor.

The contract provision for an extension of time due to delays caused by inclement weather had been deleted.

There is also a provision in the contract that the Main Contractor has to serve a notice of likely delay within fourteen days of the occurrence of any delaying event and submit a full and substantiated detail of the cause of the delay and subsequent claim within twenty-eight days after the event. No claim will be considered if this condition is not complied with.

The handover of the second part of the site is then delayed by two months due to a delay by the piling contractor.

In the early stages of the contract, as the Main Contractor hopes to catch up on the delay by reprogramming his working sequence, the Main Contractor does not file any claim for an extension of time due to the delay in possession of the second part of the site.

Halfway through the contract, due to abnormal weather conditions occurring after the handover of the second part of the site, the contract is delayed by three months. The Main Contractor, knowing that there is no way he can catch up on the delay, submits a formal claim for an extension of time due to:

1. The delay in possession of the second part of the site by two months.
2. The abnormal inclement weather and its subsequent effect, which affected the work due to the delayed possession of the second part of the site.

In addition, the Main Contractor is claiming a complete revaluation of the substructure works because he has had to carry out the said works at a much higher cost during the bad weather period in lieu of the dry season as in the original tender programme. Extra costs were incurred, including extra dewatering systems, extra temporary works for excavated areas, inefficient site operation, and reprogramming of the work sequence.

Please advise the Architect on the validity of the claim for an extension of time and for the revaluation of the substructure works.

## Assessor Notes

- Background
	- Validity of claim for EOT
	- Late handover of the second part of the site
	- Due to that, construction works have to be carried out under bad weather condition
	- Under SCC, no EOT shall be granted due to delay caused by inclement weather. MC should have already allowed the risk of inclement weather in tender
	- In early stage of the contract, MC hopes to catch up the delay by reprogramming his work sequence, therefore MC does not file any claim for EOT
- Compliance to condition precedent - notice of delay (arguable)
	- EOT claim rejected for non-compliance of condition precedent
	- Delay only realized half way through the contract and MC served notice with compliance to the stipulated condition precedent
- Validity of claim
	- May be justified if based on the sole ground that the work was delayed due to land handover of the second part of the site
	- Contractor may argue that works was carried out under different condition due to bad weather condition

#Defect #EOT
## Question

The contract has been delayed due to the Contractor's own fault, and the original contract completion date has passed. The Employer wants to take this opportunity to convert the top two floors of each tower into penthouses, thinking that the variation works could be carried out concurrently with other remaining contract works and would not cause any further delay to the already delayed programme.

After the completion of the contract and the issue of the Final Certificate, the Employer discovers that the Main Contractor had not properly carried out the suspended ceiling work in the entrance lobby. The Main Contractor had installed an acoustic tile suspended ceiling in lieu of the metal ceiling as specified. The Architect was not aware of this, and the Quantity Surveyor had not made any adjustment in the final account for such a discrepancy.

The Employer asks the Architect either to issue an instruction to the Main Contractor requiring him to change the suspended ceiling to what was specified or to issue a revised Final Certificate for such omission of works.

The Main Contractor refuses to take the Architect's instruction and claims that, as the Defects Liability Period has expired and the Final Certificate has been issued, the Employer's rights under the contract have ended except for latent defects.

Please advise the Employer on his contractual position on the following:

1. Can the Architect issue an instruction for the conversion works for the penthouse design without any possible claim from the Contractor for an extension of the contract completion date?

2. Can he take action against the Contractor for his refusal to carry out the Architect's instruction to replace the ceiling?

3. Can the Architect revise his Final Certificate in this case?

## Assessor Notes

- AI for conversion works
	- In the present case, it is not possible for the Architect to issue instruction for the conversion works for the penthouse design without any possible claim from the Contractor for EOT. The Employer cannot take advantage on the Contractor for culpable delay.
	- The Contractor may argue that the effect of the issue of variations during a period of culpable delay was to render the contract period to be at large and thus allowing the Contractor to complete the works within a reasonable time.
- Contractor refuses to carry out AI to replace ceiling
	- The acoustic ceiling installed could be easily discovered by the Architect upon reasonable examination, and is not latent defects and the Employer may be prevented from taking action against the Contractor, depending upon the precise contract provisions, after the issue of the Final Certificate.
	- In the present case, it is not clear as to 
		- Whether any Making Good Defect Certificate to be issued by Architect upon the expiry of the DLP
		- Whether the Final Certificate under the contract is conclusive evidence
	- The Final Certificate is the last certificate issued by the Architect in connection with a contract. The effects of the Final Certificate vary according to the Form of Contract being used.
	- However certain things were excluded from the conclusiveness of the Final Certificate - fraud, dishonesty, fraudulent concealment.
	- The argument put forward by the Contractor that DLP has expired and the Final Certificate had been issued, the Employer's right under the contract has ended except for latent defects. The Contractor seems to raise the question of Final Certificate is conclusive and the ceiling provided which is not in accordance to the specification / drawing is not latent defects, therefore nothing need to be done on his part. 
	- The Employer may argue that, in this case the MC may know that the ceiling is not in accordance to the specification / drawing but remains silent and it could be viewed as dishonesty or fraud. (However, it is difficult to prove in court). If this is the case, MC shall replace the ceiling according to the instruction or otherwise the MC shall reimburse the Employer for the cost different between the type of ceiling installed and the specified type of ceiling. Action can be made against MC and the Employer could sue for the damages. If the contract provisions allow for arbitration in this kind of matters, the Employer may proceed with Arbitration. 
- Can the Architect revise the Final Certificate?
	- Whether the architect can revise the Final Certificate or not depends upon the precise contract provisions.
	- In this case, the Architect has made a mistake. If a final certificate by Architect intended to be binding and conclusive, it cannot be impeached for mere negligence, or mere mistake or mere idleness on the part of Architect. Base on the principle both the Employer and Contractor even if the Architect has made a mistake they are still bound by it as both parties have agreed under the contract to be bound by it. The Architect cannot revise his final certificate.

## Question

**Quality Quantity Surveyors: Construction Cost Consultants**

**Memorandum**

**To:** A.P. Candidate  
**From:** Q. Partner  
**Date:** 7 April 1999

**Proposed Residential Development at Ma On Shan, New Territories**

I had a meeting with Mr. Oscar Ma, the Director of Wasam Development Co. Ltd, this morning. I understand that his company is planning to undertake a residential development at a plot of reclaimed land which they have recently purchased in Ma On Shan, New Territories.

Mr. Ma and his Board of Directors are at present considering two options:

- **Scheme A**: 5 blocks of 33-storey residential flats on top of a multi-storey podium
- **Scheme B**: 3 blocks of 55-storey residential flats on top of a multi-storey podium

An outline of the development is attached as **Appendix A**.

We were requested by Mr. Ma to provide him urgently with the following in order to assist him and his Board in deciding which scheme to go ahead with:

**a)**  
i) A rough indication of cost for each of the two schemes.

The specification level is to be similar to other developments in the Ma On Shan area, so you can base your costs for the 33-storey block option on the cost data derived from the tenders returned last week for Apollo Gardens, at a unit rate of HK$9,000/m² CFA for the superstructure of the residential blocks (excluding podium, external work, and contingencies). An extract of the elemental costs from the Tender analysis of Apollo Gardens is attached hereto (**Appendix B**).

ii) Identify those elements which have a difference in construction cost between the two schemes, and briefly explain the differences.

**(16 Marks)**

**b)**  
In addition to the comparison of capital costs given in (a), advise from the point of view of the Developer the pros and cons of cheme B when compared to Scheme A.

**(4 Marks)**

**c)**  
We were requested to study the additional costs for the provision of bay windows to all the flats in the development. A preliminary proposal for bay windows is attached as **Appendix C**. For this exercise, you can assume that the introduction of these bay windows does not require larger openings to the external walls and no other architectural features to the external walls are to be affected.

**(5 Marks)**

I will be out for another meeting this afternoon and be back around 4:00 pm. Please have your response drafted by then as I have to reply to the Client before 5:30pm today.

## Assessor Notes

### A

- The project data was very brief and, therefore, only a rough indication of cost is requested for both Schemes. Parts i) and ii) are inter-related and the answers can be considered together.
- Step one - calculation the CFA of the development
	- Residential flats
		- Maximum allowable GFA under the permissible plot ratio
			- 11,880 m 2 (site area) x 10 (plot ratio) = 118,800 m 2 GFA
		- Covert GFA to CFA by adding a factor of say between 3%-10% to allow for meter rooms, water tanks etc in the residential towers
			- 118,800 m 2 GFA x 1.05 (say) = 124,740 m 2 CFA
	- Podium
		- CFA derived from site coverage
			- 4 storeys x 11,880 m 2 (site area) x 85% (site coverage) = 40,392 m 2 CFA
		- Verifying the podium CFA
			- Verify the podium area (CFA) obtained in above by using the number of carparking spaces and other areas given for the podium
			- No of flats = 5 x 33 x 8 = 1,320 units
			- No of carparks = 1,320 x 1/2 = 660 no.
			- One carparking space is around 40-50 m 2 CFA
			- Total carparking area is around 26,400 m 2 to 33,000 m 2
			- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250402174959.png)
			- The CFA for the podium derived (40,392 m 2) can be accepted since it lies within this range
- Step two - prepare scheme A estimate
	- Use $9,000/m 2 CFA for the residential towers
	- Allow piling and substructure cost (say between $800 and $1,300/m 2 CFA) for the residential towers and other areas unless the elemental unit rates for other areas have already included the piling and substructure costs
	- Use unit rates per m 2 CFA (including piling and substructure) for the other areas within the following ranges
		- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250402175410.png)
	- Allow for landscaping to the podium deck and for external works
	- Allow contingencies of at least 10%
	- List excluded items
	- Give a brief description of the project and the standard of development
- Step three - prepare Scheme B estimate and identify and explain the difference in elemental costs between Schemes A & B
	- Since limited time and information are available only a rough indication of cost is required. The candidate should adjust the estimate of Scheme A to arrive at the Scheme B estimate. The construction cost for a 55-storey residential tower will, generally, be more expensive due to the following: - 
		- The CFA of the super-highrise buildings should be larger as a result of: -
			- Refuge floors and at least the cost for one level of refuge floor ($5,000 - $7,000/m 2) per tower should be allowed
			- More lifts and, thus, require a much larger lift lobby
		- Most elemental costs for Scheme B are generally higher than those for Scheme A (with the exception of the 'roof' and 'piling and foundation' elements):-
		- The candidate is expected to work out the elemental costs for Scheme B by making adjustment to the elemental costs given in Appendix B (which is the basis of the Scheme A estimate)
		- The candidate is also requested to identify those elements which have a difference in construction cost and briefly explain the reasons for higher costs. Some sample explanations are given below but assessors can accept other appropriate explanations
			- Preliminaries (generally)
				- Efficiency of labour is lower as it takes longer for workers to travel to upper floors
				- Similarly, the transportation of plant and materials also takes more time and costs more
				- High scaffolding costs, etc.
			- Structural frame and slab
				- Larger columns and thicker structural walls at lower floors
				- Higher grades of concrete are sometimes used for lower floors
			- External walls windows
				- More difficult to carry out works to external walls at higher levels due to windload
				- Thicker glass for windows at upper floors to withstand windload
			- Plumbing and drainage
				- Larger pipe sizes for risers at lower floors in order to support the same flow rate at upper floors
				- Heavier duty valves and accessories are to be used in connection with higher working pressure
				- The design is relatively more advanced and sophisticated
			- Gas
				- Larger pipe sizes for risers at lower floors in order to support the same flow rate at upper floors
				- Heavier duty valves and accessories are to be used in connection with higher working pressure
			- Fire services
				- Larger pipe sizes for risers at lower floors in order to support the same flow rate at upper floors
				- Heavier duty valves and accessories are to be used in connection with higher working pressure
				- The design is relatively more advanced and sophisticated
			- Electrical installation
				- More expensive main and sub-main distribution system is required as the electrical loading is more divergent from the Main Switch Room
				- The design is relatively more advanced and sophisticated
			- Lifts
				- Total distance of travel is loner
				- Faster lifts are required for higher zone
				- No corresponding reduction in the number of lifts
			- Roof
				- The candidate should identify that the elemental costs for the roof in Scheme B would be lower because of the reduction in the number of roofs
			- Piling and foundation
				- The piling and foundation costs depend very much on the design but, normally, the foundation cost for super-highrise buildings may even be lower because of the reduction of the number of tower. However, if the candidate can give a reasonable argument for an upward adjustment e.g additional windload to withstand for taller buildings, etc, it may be accepted
			- Landscaping
				- The candidate should make cost allowance for the additional landscaping work to cover the additional podium deck area as a result of the reduction in the number of towers from 5 to 3

### B

- Advantages
	- More open space or landscaping area at the podium deck for the residents' enjoyment
	- More flats at higher level which can offer better views and, hence, better sale prices
	- Less number of caretakers would be required (3 towers in lieu of 5 towers to be looked after)
- Disadvantages
	- Longer construction period, finance charges for construction is higher and investment return is delayed
	- Less usable floor area
	- Higher maintenance costs to external walls and windows when scaffolding is required or gondola
	- Longer waiting time for lifts
- Methodology
	- From different point of view
		- Employer / Designer / Contractor
		- Facility Manager / End User
	- In different stages
		- Design stage
		- Construction stage
		- Maintenance stage

### C

- A simple measurement exercise with approximate quantities for the following items are to be made. The sizes can be obtained from Appendix. The following should be itemised:-
	- Suspended concrete slabs to top and bottom of the bay windows
	- Formwork
	- Reinforcement
	- External tile finishes
	- Internal plaster finishes
	- Granite slab window sill and backing
	- Windows panel to two sides
	- Preliminaries
- The candidate should use rough / approximate quantities and no detailed measurement or adjustment is expected
- Reasonable unt rates for pricing the items of work are expected

	Attention: Mr. Q. Partner
	
	15 September 1999
	
	Dear Sirs,
	
	Proposed Residential Development at Ma On Shan, New Territories
	
	We received a letter (copy enclosed) from the Main Contractor yesterday requesting an extension of time for the six-week delay in respect of the suspension we ordered for the investigation of Pile Cap Nos. CP5 to CP8, subsequent to the discovery of the non-compliance of Pile No. CP4 with the concrete specification, and for an ascertainment of the loss and expense allegedly incurred as a result.
	
	Though Pile Cap Nos. CP5 to CP8 were subsequently found to be in compliance with the relevant concrete specifications, they were cast from the same batch of ready-mixed concrete supplied by the same concrete supplier. It seemed perfectly reasonable at the time to suspect that Pile Cap Nos. CP5 to CP8 might also encounter the same strength problems as those affecting Pile Cap No. CP4, and, therefore, to issue the suspension order as we did.
	
	The Main Contractor now relies on the favorable test results for both time and cost claims. We are aware of the difficulties facing us in view of Clause 23(i) and Clause 24(1)(b) of the General Conditions of Contract. However, we note Special Conditions of Contract SCC-8 and SCC-9, which bar both time and cost claims from the Main Contractor if suspension is rendered necessary for the satisfactory completion of the Works by reason of some default on the part of the Main Contractor.
	
	The Main Contractor has threatened to sue the employer unless the employer releases the liquidated damages presently withheld before the end of next week. We would like to have your advice in writing by the end of this week regarding the following questions:
	
	1. The validity of both of the Main Contractor's claims in principle.
	2. The Main Contractor's claim regarding the liquidated damages and whether we may now issue a Non-Completion Certificate to justify the withholding of the liquidated damages, allowing time to make a final decision on the Main Contractor's entitlement to any extension of time.
	
	Yours faithfully,  
	For and on behalf of Able Architects Limited

	Dear Sirs,
	
	### Re: Proposed Residential Development at Ma On Shan, New Territories
	
	We refer to the Employer's payment in the sum of HK$25,000,000, received yesterday in settlement of Payment Certificate No. MC-8, which is HK$3,000,000 less than the amount certified. The employer’s covering letter states that the deduction is for liquidated damages due to a six-week delay.
	
	The entire six-week delay was caused by the suspension order instructed under A.I. No. 36. We protested at the time that the suspension was wholly unnecessary, given that the coring tests for Pile Cap Nos. CP5 - CP8 could have been conducted concurrently with the remaining caps' construction. We attach, for your easy reference, our letter issued at the time. Subsequent test reports show that there is no non-compliance with the relevant concrete specification.
	
	Though the suspension only lasted for four weeks, all reinforcing bars that were fixed became rusty during this period, requiring two more weeks for replacement. We therefore consider ourselves fully entitled to a six-week extension under Clause 23 and recovery of the associated loss and expense under Clause 24, based on the positive test results.
	
	While we are prepared to allow a reasonable time to resolve the quantum of loss and expense, we cannot accept that liquidated damages are being withheld any longer, as if we were in default. Please advise the employer that unless we receive the balance of HK$3,000,000 by the end of next week, legal proceedings will be instituted without further notice.
	
	Yours faithfully,

	Dear Sirs,
	
	### Re: Proposed Residential Development at Ma On Shan, New Territories – Suspension Order
	
	We refer to your A.I. No. 36 (received this Thursday) ordering the suspension of all concreting works, except for tests that may be instructed by the Project Structural Engineer.
	
	On the same day, the Project Structural Engineer instructed that concrete samples be cored from Pile Cap Nos. CP5 to CP8.
	
	We advise that necessary arrangements have been made with the agreed material testing laboratory, and formal testing reports are expected to be ready in about two weeks' time.
	
	We have consulted the concrete supplier, and both the concrete supplier and ourselves are of the view that the strength problem encountered in Pile Cap No. CP4 was an isolated incident. We are confident that the test reports for CP5 to CP8, when available, will confirm full compliance with the relevant concrete specifications. However, we are concerned that unnecessary delay and costs will be incurred due to the suspension, which, in our view, was not necessary for the satisfactory completion of the works.
	
	We do not see any compelling reason why the samples cannot be taken while the remaining cap construction is allowed to proceed as normal.
	
	We are willing to undertake all consequences if any part of the continued construction is subsequently found to be non-compliant, provided you agree to allow the construction to proceed.
	
	Your urgent reply is requested.

## Assessor Notes

Candidates are expected to demonstrate their abilities in expressing the logic in their approach to the question. Marks may be awarded to their knowledge of the legal principles, rather than precise details behind the answer.

- Analysis of the various issues of the case
	- The candidate should first deal with the Client's concern of the Contractor's threat to go to Court which, if effected, is very imminent.
	- The issues with which the Candidate should deal include: -
		- Validity of deducting LD in the absence of a valid non-completion certificate
			- No, refer to GCC
		- Can a LD deduction be validated by a subsequent non-completion certificate?
			- No 
			- Unless deduction under common law by requesting the arbitrator to exercise his review powers with respect to the alleged failure on the part of the Architect to issue non-completion certificate at the relevant time
		- Can the Architect validly issue a non-completion certificate without first assessing a prima facie valid EOT application?
			- No, GCC Architect's duty to assess EOT & need to address EOT first before certificate
		- Can the Contractor go to court in view of the arbitration clause?
			- Yes, demonstrate whether the non-payment is a dispute or difference
			- Unless under common law in reliance on which the employer may ask for a stay of court proceedings
		- Whether SCC 8 & 9 are applicable?
			- What was the real cause of delay - any necessity for suspension in order to conduct further tests or any other compelling reasons for a suspension in the circumstances
			- The candidate should appreciate the dual requirements under both SCC 8 & 9 - the existence of at least some default on the Contractor's part and the existence of a causal link between the default in question and the need to postpone the Works for satisfactory completion of the Works
			- The real cause needs further investigation. If the A/SE cannot give compelling reasons for a suspension order (in order to allow further tests to be conducted), prima facie there was no causal link between the suspension and the carrying out of further tests (which has never been in dispute). In such a case, the question whether CP 4 constituted a default within the meaning of SCC-8 & 9 would be largely academic and of little contractual significance. In any event, even if CP 4 were a default, that still would not have necessitated a suspension for the satisfactory completion of the works. The candidate is expected to discuss the above with the A/SE over the phone and indicate that in back-up phone note, etc to support his / her conclusion.
			- As a separate point, the candidate should invite A/SE to assess whether a further 2 weeks for removing rusty reinforcement was a reasonable period and indicate such enquiry in back-up documents.
			- If there existed compelling reasons for a suspension, then the effect of the Contractor's earlier request to proceed together with an undertaking of consequences would require comment. The candidate is expected to display his own judgement depending on what the reasons area.
		- What practical solutions are available to the Client?
			- The candidate is expected to offer practical solutions. There may not be sufficient time to conduct a full enquiry, make a proper EOT assessment and to resolve the present impasse with the Contractor. There should be a brief review of the Employer's situation and say a quick check as to whether the balance of contract sum is likely to cover the potential LD, if so the Employer has a option (irrespective of the strength of his case) to release the payment withheld either in whole or in part without jeopardizing a subsequent deduction.
			- Candidates should not assume the Contractor will necessarily maintain a confrontational approach. The candidate could seek Employer's approval to contract the Contractor to explore avenues for a more mutually acceptable solution instead of going to court. Either agreeing with the Contractor to allow a further period for proper assessment of EOT or to release of LD withheld (in whole or in part) on agreed terms is evidence of the candidate's recognition of the need, in practice, to take on a pro-active role in resolving conflicts rather than adhering to stringent contractual analysis.

## Question

ANSWER ALL PARTS OF THIS QUESTION:

Pre-contract Stage

- 3a 
	You have prepared draft tender documents stipulating, according to your standard office practice, that the Contractor should procure an on-default performance bond for 5% of the Contract Sum, to be released upon practical completion of the Contract.
	
	Your Client, Mr. Chung of Westley Land Ltd., has the following queries on your draft:
	
	1. Why not specify an on-demand performance bond?
	2. Is 5% adequate? Why not specify a higher percentage, say, for the full contract sum?
	
	Please draft a reply letter to your Client to support your draft tender documents.
	(6 Marks)

- 3b 
	Your supervisor suddenly called you to his office and gave you the following quotation, which was just faxed over from Mr. Chung of Westley Land Ltd., a very important and experienced Client.
	
	The quotation was submitted for the design-and-build of a site office, which will last for a few years in preparation for a major development. The tenderer is a very small contractor who usually works as a sub-contractor and is not very good in English.
	
	In view of the size of the contract and the tenderer, the Client is happy to accept the quotation, subject to checking by your office, and is content to conclude the contract by means of an exchange of simple letters. He would not use a Standard Form of Contract.
	
	The Client expects your office to fax to him, within 2 hours, a list of essential comments on the quotation together with a list of 10 essential items to be included in the acceptance letter so that he can use them in discussions with the tenderer later on the same day to conclude the matter.
	
	You will not be able to contact the Client within the next 2 hours. Please respond accordingly.

	Long after the commencement of a contract containing a provision for submission of a performance bond for 5% of the Contract Sum to be released upon practical completion of the Contract, the Contractor still fails to submit a satisfactory performance bond. The Contract does not contain any provision for non-payment in case of non-submission of the performance bond.
	
	Please draft a letter to the Contractor advising him, with valid argument, that certain deductions will be made from the payment due to the non-submission of the performance bond.	(2 Marks)

- 3d 
	The Contractor later submitted a performance bond with only one deviation. He advised that his Bank maintained that the expiry date for the bond must be a specific calendar date and the original date for completion of the Contract had been used. Please draft a letter to the Client, Mr. Chung of Westley Land Ltd., to:
	
	1. Explain why this is not acceptable; 
	2. Suggest any compromise solution with modified terms of the bond in case the Contractor insists on a specific calendar date for expiry.

	You have received a call from your friend, Joseph Chin, working as a sub-contractor. Unfortunately, his various subcontracts had suffered damage from the same severe typhoon occurring a few weeks ago. The only comfort is that all the various main contractors have taken out a Contractors' All Risks insurance policy. However, the main contractors have different ways of treating the liability for excesses under the insurance policy. Some require the sub-contractor to bear the full amount of the excess, while others require the sub-contractor to share the excess with the other parties suffering from the same typhoon damage. Your friend is seeking advice from various sources.
	
	Please draft advice to your friend on the correct interpretation of the unamended Standard Form of Contract or Sub-Contract most familiar to you in regard to:
	
	1. Fundamental liability of the contracting parties (with or without insurance provisions),
	2. Liability in respect of excesses,
	3. Liability in case the limit of indemnity is inadequate to cover the loss.
	(6 Marks)

## Assessor Notes

- 3 a
	- Reasons for not specifying an on-demand performance bond
		- Not a normal practice
		- Not procurable by those contractors who have low level of cash or bank credit - these contractor may need to deposit an amount equal to the amount of the on-demand performance bond with the bank as security
		- High risk to contracts with resultant higher tender prices
		- Less competitive tenders because of fewer number of financially capable tenderers and higher tender prices
	- Argument as to adequacy of 5%
		- Whether 5% is adequate depends on the time of the contract when the default in question occurs
		- It may not be adequate at certain times, say when a lot of items of work are only partially constructed
		- 5% is the industry standard which should provide some (though may not be all) degree of protection, without losing competitive tenders
		- A higher percentage may be specified but it will attract higher tender prices
		- A 100% coverage will greatly decrease the number of willing and able tenderers
- 3 b
	- Comment on quotation
		- Substructure
			- Excavation misting, site work missing
			- Foundation depth not specified
			- Rebar amount wrong
		- Superstructure
			- Formwork quantity wrong
			- Beam formwork missing
			- Steel ratio too low
			- Plaster and paint to beam sides missing
			- No pump an sanitary fittings
			- No underground drainage
		- Preliminary
			- No bond and insurance
	- Items for LOA
		- Name of contract parities
		- Project description
		- Scope of works
		- Contract sum
		- Contract sum to be lump sum, fixed price, all inclusive
		- Basis of contract or list of contract documents
		- Provisions for adjustment of contract sum
		- Commencement date and contract period
		- Provisions for EOT
		- LAD
		- Acceptance standard
		- DLP
		- Payment terms
		- Insurance and bond
- 3 c Reasons for making deductions from payments due to non-submission of the performance bond
	- Submission of performance bond is a condition of the contract. Failure in submission is a fundamental breach
	- Employer is essentially acting as the surety during the period of non-submission of the performance bond and taking up the risk
	- Cash security by way of deductions from payments is one of the ways to alleviate the Employer's risk
- 3 d
	- Reasons that a specific calendar date for the expiry of a performance bond is not acceptable
		- In case of delayed completion, a bond with a specific calendar date for expiry has to be extended when the expiry date is near. However the surety may refuse the extension if at that time he finds that the risk of the contractor being not able to complete the Works is high. The Employer will then lose his protection. Therefore the expiry date must be a floating date until Practical Completion thus allowing for delays.
		- The candidate is expected to explain why on the one hand a bond with fixed expiry date is not acceptable and on the other hand a compromise solution is to be considered:
		- Banks obviously would not like a floating expiry date and would try to use a specific calendar date. Small contractors having lesser financial standing would have less bargaining power and would have real difficulties in obtaining a bond with a floating expiry date.
	- Compromise solution
		- A compromise solution with modified terms of bond would be to specify a much later calendar date for expiry with reasonably adequate allowance for delay, say original contract completion +6 or 12 months. 
- 3 e
	- The liability for excess or inadequate limit of indemnity rests with the party who is fundamentally liable for the consequence of damage by typhoon under the Contract

	Your domestic sub-contractor, Holinground Co., is responsible for substructure excavation. Damage to utility cables was reported, and the Site Agent alleged that it was due to your inaccurate setting out, which also caused part of the footing to intrude onto adjacent ground. The Clerk-of-Works verbally demanded immediate suspension of that part of the works. Holinground argued that the cables were not clearly shown on the drawings.
	
	This came to your immediate attention, as the Main Contractor’s quantity surveyor, at the Main Contractor's head office via a phone call from your Site Agent. Act upon it now:
	
	List the courses of action which the Main Contractor needs to take, whether concerning internal or external organisations, including the prioritised list of actions to be taken by the Site Agent, people to contact, and any other matters as you deem necessary.

	The Client awarded a contract for the fitting out of 10 serviced apartments under the minor works contract to the Contractor, Fitaflata Home Ltd. Proprietary kitchen units by Wokanpot were specified. The Contractor showed the Client a catalogue of kitchen units from Kettleanpan in the presence of the Architect during a site visit. The Client was quick to pick Kettleanpan Type W from the catalogue.
	
	During another site visit, the Architect found that half of all of the kitchen worktops were scratched and dented and verbally condemned the work. Fitaflata Home decided to replace the worktops with local material and, subsequently, claimed extra payment.
	
	On inspection, the Architect was not satisfied with the workmanship of the replaced worktops and refused to pay the extra. The Architect further argued that Kettleanpan is not an equivalent standard to Wokanpot and insisted on the defective units being replaced with those of Wokanpot.
	
	Fitaflata Home now seeks your Consultant firm's advice as an Independent Quantity Surveyor. Your Supervisor requests you to summarise in a memo to him the key issues of what went wrong, who was at fault, and what should have been done, to enable him to draft a comprehensive reply to Fitaflata Home.

## Assessor Notes

- 4 a
	- Keep record of this incidence, including taking photo etc immediately
	- Notify other parties, such as architect, utility company and insurance company
	- Check the source of error resulting in footing protrusion and cable damage by investigating: -
		- Whether information of the cable is shown on drawings?
		- If shown, whether the location of the cable is correctly indicated?
		- Whether information regarding the setting out of the footing is correctly shown?
		- If there an obligation for MC to check accuracy of drawings?
		- Has MC discharged his duties?
		- Does the DSC have the responsibility / obligation to check the same?
	- Consider the rights and liabilities of the various parties, such as
		- Can MC withhold payment and / or set off against DSC (if it is the DSC responsibility)?
		- Can MC claim against client (if the drawings contain error)?

- 4 b
	- Alternative courses of action
		- Approach the Liquidator regarding the possibility of NSC to complete the project
		- Ask MC to complete the remaining works as variations to MC. This alternative has the advantages of speed and continuity. Additional costs to contra charge against NSC
		- Engage another contractor, either as a re-nominated sub-contractor to MC or as a direct contractor (via negotiation / cost plus, etc) and contra charge against NSC

- 4 c
	- Contractor ought to 
		- Have obtained formal approval to the use of K before installation
		- Have obtained formal approval for repair work to be carried out with local material
		- Proceed with repair work in local material only after approval was given
	- Architect should have
		- Drawn the client's attention that the catalogue of K was offered during the site visit
		- Made his choice clear to the contractor before delivery
		- Upon delivery of visible damage, made known to the contractor what action was required: e.g.
			- To be replaced by W
			- Whether contractor should carry out the repair work
	- Discussion
		- Whether W is specified as 'W or equivalent'?
		- If W is not nominated, architect may accept equivalent products in equivalent standard
		- With understanding that the client has selected K, Architect should not insist on W
		- Contractor could have a back to back agreement to back-charge at his sub-contractor / supplier for the cost of making good
		- Whether remedial work utilising local material constitute equivalent standard to W?
		- Contractor's rationale in offering alternative of K to the client e.g. due to cost / availability?
		- Suggestion to settle the dispute by negotiation / commercial settlement with client using K (cost / availability) e.g. remedial works / reasonable deduction of contract sum
		- It can be argued that the Architect, by action, have accepted K
		- Contractor is not entitled to claim extra payment for the repair
		- Architect may insist on having equivalent standard to those of W

## Question

QUESTION ON CIVIL ENGINEERING

The following question relates to the construction of a highway. The candidate should suggest the appropriate conditions of contract. The Standard Method of Measurement for Civil Engineering Works 1992 should be used. The candidate should also state which other standard documents the candidate relies on in providing the answer.

A highway project of approximately 8 km, which passes through several areas under the jurisdiction of different district authorities, has been let to two contractors in joint venture. The contractors were experienced roadwork and tunnel contractors. The tunnel portion of the works, which consisted of both tunnels and roadwork within the tunnel section, was carried out by TL Contractor. The roadwork portion of the work was carried out by RW Contractor. Each contractor started from different ends of the highway with the intention that the two portions of the work would join together to form a complete project on a specific date. The two separate sections had different amounts for liquidated damages but with one completion date.

ANSWER ALL PARTS OF THIS QUESTION

- 5a  
	On the third day in the mobilization stage of the project, RW Contractor encountered obstructions from villagers who strongly opposed the mobilization activities carried out by the contractor. The district authority stepped in and arranged a meeting between the villagers and RW Contractor on Day 4. After the first meeting, the representative from the district authority suggested that RW Contractor should suspend the mobilization activities since the villagers are strongly opposed to works being undertaken adjacent to the graves of the villagers' ancestors. The Engineer's Representative (ER), who had attended the meeting, drafted a letter to RW Contractor to start mobilization. It is specified in the Special Conditions of Contract that the contractor should satisfy the requirements of the district authorities. RW Contractor has sensed a threat of violence and possible riot from the villagers and decided to suspend the works. A notice for delay was served to the ER. The ER did not find the cause of delay justifiable and intended to instruct RW Contractor to proceed with the mobilization works.
	
	Advise the Engineer on the implications of this notice of delay in order to minimize time and cost exposure due to the potential delay to the construction programme.
	(15 Marks)

- 5b  
	While RW Contractor was awaiting a resolution to the villagers' strong opposition, TL Contractor anticipated a delay of approximately eight weeks in the shipment of tunneling equipment due to a strike in Europe. Such delay was documented in the minutes of progress meetings. In anticipation of an approximately 12 weeks delay caused by the villagers (refer to item a above), TL Contractor did not serve any notice of delay to the Engineer. RW Contractor was able to start work again after 5 weeks disruption. TL Contractor, at that point in time, served a notice of delay of 8 weeks to the Engineer. ER suggested that this claim was time-barred.
	
	Advise the Engineer regarding TL Contractor's entitlement to extensions of time with relevant advice on the implications to the key issues of the Contract.

-  5c  
	In the remeasurement of quantities for the final account, RW Contractor included an additional item for concrete curbs along the fence constructed on both sides of the highway. The total additional cost was approximately $5 million. The details were as follows:
	
	BQ description: Fencing – Chain link fence type I as shown on Drawing No. XXXX, 12000 m.  
	Drawing: Highways Department Standard Drawing No. XXXX shows a dotted line along the bottom of the chain link fence with the annotation "150 x 380 MIN. Concr. Curb."
	
	RW Contractor argued that the item for fencing in the SMM does not include concrete curb. Concrete curb is, therefore, an additional item that needs to be measured.
	
	Provide a response to RW Contractor's request.

## Question

(Answer 3 out of 4 sub-questions)

- **1.1 Commitment for Land Bid**  
	An experienced developer is going to bid in an open land auction for a plot of land in Hong Kong for residential purposes only, with some car parking spaces.
	
	He is now talking to a construction company, with whom he had a close working relationship before, to obtain a firm offer for the construction of the project so that he can work out a more certain bid price for the land (with a committed construction cost).
	
	In order to protect the interests of the Developer with regard to time, cost, and quality, draft a letter to the Developer as a Consultant QS offering specific advice on the essential terms to be included in the agreement between the Developer and the construction company.
	
	It would not be acceptable to list out all the usual terms and conditions from a standard form of building contract. The essential terms to be described must be appropriate for these circumstances.

- **1.2 BQ Production Information and Programme**  
	You are a Consultant QS. You have advised, in a Project Meeting, that you would need 6 weeks to prepare the Bills of Quantities for all trades, including plumbing and drainage but excluding other M&E services, for a development comprising a 30-storey residential tower on a 3-storey commercial podium.
	
	The Architect (including in-house structural engineers) has expressed concern over his ability to issue all of the drawings all in one go on Day 1 and has requested you to give him a prioritized list of information required from him so that some information may be given to you later.
	
	Draft a BQ production programme with staff allocation for the 6 weeks for internal reference and then draft a letter giving the Architect the prioritized list he requested.

- **1.3 Electronic Tender Documents**  
	You are a Consultant QS. Your Boss has received enquiries from prospective tenderers asking for computer file copies of the tender documents to be issued together with the usual hard copies to facilitate their tendering. Your Firm uses a common word processing software for the front parts and a common spreadsheet software for the BQ.
	
	Your Boss would like you to list out in a memo:
	
	(a) Some of the advantages of such an arrangement to all parties involved; and  
	(b) The likely drawbacks to your Firm and pitfalls that your Firm has to watch out for.
	
	You are also required to give an overall view on whether the whole thing is a good idea or not.
	
	Please respond.

- **1.4 Contractor's Joint Venture Agreement**  
	You are the QS manager of a local building contractor, which is considering forming a joint venture with an overseas building services contractor to bid for a major design and build construction project in Hong Kong.
	
	Your Managing Director wants you to highlight the main points to be covered in the joint venture agreement in relation to the profit, cost, and liability elements.
	
	The Accountant will deal with the usual matters which would appear in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of a new company.
	
	Please respond.

	(a) The construction cost of the project is agreed to be an average of $8,000/m² of total construction floor area (including the areas of all car parking spaces and other lease GFA non-accountable areas);  
	
	(b) The average anticipated selling price of the residential flats will be equivalent to $45,000/m² of the construction floor area of the residential flats, and that of the car park will be $450,000/No. In three years' time with no pre-sale;  
	
	(c) The interest rate is 10% per annum; and  
	
	(d) The construction period is 2.5 years,
	
	Calculate the likely bidding price for the land, having taken into account other associated costs.
	
	Calculate also the effect on the construction cost if the likely bidding price is increased by 5%.

- **2.2 Quality Assurance**
	You are the team leader responsible for BQ production within a Consultant QS firm or a Contracting Company with a special assignment for quality assurance.
	
	**Option (i):**  
	Draft a letter to explain to the quality assurance auditor the process of production of the measured works sections of the BQ by breaking the process into a number of distinct functional stages. State whether the process is aided by computer.
	
	Relate the operations involved in each stage with respect to compliance with the requirements of ISO 9000.
	
	Your explanation should cover the time from the commencement of BQ production until the issuance of tender documents, assuming that there is no need for a tender addendum.
	
	**Option (ii):**  
	Draft a memo to explain to the newly recruited QS graduates the process of production of the measured works sections of the BQ by breaking the process into a number of distinct functional stages. State whether the process is aided by computer.
	
	Explain the procedures and measures to be adopted in each stage to ensure the production of the measured works sections of a quality BQ within time and budget.
	
	Your explanation should cover the time from the commencement of BQ production until the issuance of tender documents, assuming that there is no need for a tender addendum.

- **2.3 Why Not Without BQ**
	2 out of the agreed 6 weeks for BQ production have gone, but the drawings have not arrived on schedule. At today's Project Meeting, you reported the slow progress by the Architect and advised the Project Manager that firm Bills of Quantities would not be possible.
	
	The Project Manager and the Architect asked whether tenders could be invited without a BQ since the BQ production would be so time-consuming. You resisted the idea and suggested adopting a provisional BQ.
	
	After the meeting, your assistants asked you why you did not accept the others' proposal, always assuming that the fee would remain unchanged.
	
	Please explain your choice.

- **2.4 Phased Possession**  
	You are a Consultant QS. According to the arrangement as agreed at today's Project Meeting, the Site will be divided into two Portions, namely Portions A and B. While the Employer is still working out the exact dates, it is anticipated that possession of Portion A will be granted to the Main Contractor upon commencement of the Contract, i.e., around March 2001. The commencement might be delayed by two to three weeks, but the delay is unlikely to exceed one month. Possession of Portion B will be granted three months after Portion A is released to the Main Contractor, i.e., by June 2001 according to the present timetable.
	
	The currently drafted tender documents contain the following:
	
	- Clause 21(1) of the Conditions of Contract:
		- On the Date for Possession stated in the appendix to these Conditions, possession of the site shall be given to the Main Contractor who shall thereupon begin the Works and regularly and diligently proceed with the same, and who shall complete the same on or before the Date for Completion stated in the said appendix, subject nevertheless to the provisions for extension of time contained in clauses 23 and 33(1)(c) of these Conditions.
		- Particulars to be inserted in the “Appendix to Conditions of Contract”
	- Clause 21 - Date for Possession:  
		- Portion A: Mid April 2001  
		- Portion B: Mid July 2001
	
	Your Boss has asked you to re-draft the above provisions to accommodate the phased possession arrangement.
	
	Revisions to accommodate phased completion and liquidated damages would not be necessary.
	
	Please respond.

- **2.5 Types of Drawings**
	Your Client, a first-time Developer, called this morning and said that he was quite confused in the Project Meeting yesterday during which the various types of drawings involved in the Project were discussed.
	
	He requested you to write to him explaining the function of each of the following types of drawings and why there is a need to identify them as such:
	
	(a) BQ Drawings  
	(b) Superseded Drawings  
	(c) Tender Drawings  
	(d) Addendum Drawings  
	(e) Contract Drawings  
	(f) Construction/Working Drawings  
	(g) Shop Drawings
	
	Furthermore, now that the Architect has prepared almost all of the drawings, your Client would like you to recommend what drawings should be issued to the tenderers with the tender documents. The current tender is for the superstructure Main Contract with firm bills of quantities for builder's works and with M&E services installations only kept as Prime Cost Sums.
	
	Please respond.

## Question

- **3.1 P.C. Rate**
	In the tender documentation period, the Employer has not selected the tiles to be used in the lift lobbies. He wishes to specify a P.C. rate of $5700/m² for the lobby tiles in the tender documents instead of specifying their brand names and model numbers.
	
	Explain the pros and cons of using a P.C. rate.
	
	Describe two possible methods for adjusting the P.C. rate in the final account for contracts with BQ.
	
	Explain the rationale behind the two methods.
	
	Illustrate the methods by using an actual supply rate of $0.7/No. For 96x96x8 mm tile and an all-in rate of $300/m².
	
	Describe any further considerations for contracts without BQ.

- **3.2 Tender Report for Design and Build**
	You are a Consultant QS. After attending a meeting with all the Consultants to vet a design and build tender, your Boss has asked you to prepare a list of headings (each with a one-sentence brief description of its purpose) that should be incorporated in a joint tender report for presentation to the Developer Client. Please respond.
	
	Also, elaborate on three areas which would need to be covered in this report but which would not normally be addressed in the tender report for a lump sum construction-only contract.

- **3.3 Discounts**
	You are working for a Developer and you are responsible for negotiating tenders from contractors.
	
	Draft a memo to your assistants to set out (by way of formulae if you like) at least 5 ways that discounts offered on the tendered sums can be applied for post-contract and final account purposes, and their relative merits in different situations.

- **3.4 Lift Contractors' Limitation on L.D.**
	**Option (i) answered as the Consultant QS:** All of the lift tenderers have qualified their tenders by insisting that their liability for liquidated damages for delay be limited to a maximum of 10% of their contract sums, whether it be a direct contract or a Nominated Sub-Contract.
	
	The Main Contract will be tendered in the next month. There will be no provisions for extension of time in respect of delay on the part of Nominated Sub-Contractors.
	
	The Project Manager has asked you to draft a special clause to be included in the Main Contract to deal with this limitation so that the Employer's entitlement to liquidated damages would not be diminished when the lift installation is included as a Nominated Sub-Contract.
	
	The Project Manager has further asked you to advise whether it would be more advisable to engage the lift company as a direct contractor.
	
	Please respond.
	
	**Option (ii) answered as the Contractor's QS:** After the award of the Main Contract, the lift company was nominated to your company, and only then was your company notified of the limitation imposed by the lift company on its liability for liquidated damages (similar to that described under Option (i)).
	
	Draft a letter to the Architect to object to the qualifications and make a counter proposal, bearing in mind that other lift companies will have the same qualification.
## Assessor Notes

- 3.1
	- Pros and cons
		- Deferring the selection of tiles and therefore allowing E, in selecting the tile, to take into account the latest info (e.g. design progress, construction progress, tile availability, etc.)
		- Avoiding specifying tiles in BQ that my become obsolete during post contract stage
		- Avoiding the premium that E may have to pay due to variations to a specified tile in post contract stage
		- Providing major developers with greater bargaining power in procuring the tiles through bulk purchase
		- Creating uncertinty in pricing fixing cost as the determining factors for assessing wastage allowance and labour content are not exactly known at the tender stage e.g. size of tiles, laying patterns, application methods, etc.
		- Resulting in uncertain cost commitment due to possible fluctuation in the price of the tiles
		- Reducing possibility of tenderers pricing very differently for the same specified tiles
		- Introducing other checking work during the tender examiniation to ensure that tendered rates and discounted tender rates are not lower than P.C. rates
	- Two adjustment metods and rationale
		- (actuall supply rate - P.C. rate) x (1 + wastage) x (1 + profit and overhead) x final account qty
			- Theoretically correct, but wastage and progit and overhead percentages need to be stated in advance to avoid argument
		- (actual supply rate - P.C. rate) x final acount qty
			- Simplest and commonly used, but a preamble clause should be included to the effect
			- Wastage and profit and overhead are not adjusted. This would usually favour C in overall term because actual supply rates should be less than P.C. rate for budgetary control. In case the actual suplly rate is very much higher than P.C. rate such that allowance for wastage becomes unrealistic, C may have a case for upward adjustment
		- Adjustment may initially be based on BQ qty and the adjusted all-in-rates applied to variation qty
	- W/o BQ
		- In theory, there should be no difference between contracts w/ or w/o BQ. The rate adjustment should be the same
		- Final Account qty should be those authorized as built qty measured nett as fixed in place with no allowance for wastage, though, in practice, they are measured from drawings
		- Difficulties arise for contracts w/o BQ because the qty in the SOR or SOT do not form part of the contract, there is no accurate qyty for making the cost adjustment and the drawings need to be measured again in order to obtain the accurate qty
		- Alternative may be adopted, e.g. by deeming the qty in SOR or SOT as accurate for P.C. rate adjustment purpose and for that purpose only, or by deeming some other qty estimated by QS for that purpose
- 3.2
	- List of headings
		- Tender received
			- Tender sum and contract period
			- Declining tender
		- Scope of tenders
		- Specified exlusions
		- Type of tenders
		- Submissions received
		- Comparison and evaluation of design

		- Comparison and evaluation of financial capacility of tenderers
		- Reconciliation with budget costs and time
		- Matters to be resolved with tenderers
		- Conclusion and recommendation
		- Validity period of tenders
- 3.3
	- 5 discounting methods
		- (1) Lump sum without affecting unit rates for variations
		- (2) Expressed as a percentage discount on all rates and prices except pc and pro sum
		- (3) As above and excluding prelim further
		- (4) As above and excluding profit and overhead further
		- (5) As above and excluding value of pc rates
	- Relative merits
		- If variation adittions are expected, reduced unit rates will favour E against C
		- If variation omissions are expected, reduced unit rates will favour C against E
		- Method (1) would be simplest while (5) will be the most tedious
		- Method (1) would be determental to C if the SOW is subtantially reduced, say a phase or portion omitted as permitted under Contract
		- Beware that all-in rates will not be discounted to be smaller than pc rates
		- Method (4) would not have the above problem but is not logically correct if the discount is understood as a global reduction of profit margin since profit margin is marked up on costs including pc rates. It would be logical if the discount is understood as the expected result of all possible reduction of all costs and profit under C's own control. In this case pc rates are not under C's control.
- 3.4
	- Option (i)
		- Special clause in MC
			- Clause to inform the Main Contract tenderers the qualifications of the lift tenderers, and to require them to price for the risks and absorb the shortfall in liquidated damages in case of delay
			- Though it seems unfair to the Main Contractor, but it is a situation that he would face as well if the lift is placed as a domestic work. Further more, the Main Contractor may not always get back-to-back contract with his domestic sub-contractors.
		- Whether advisable to engage as direct contractor
			- Depending on whether the lift installation is really a critical parat of the Main Contract Works
			- Usually yes, but sometimes no when fireman's lift is not required
			- If critical, then not advisable, otherwise the MC wil put plame on lift contractor for delay which is really the MC's. It may also be prossible that MC and the lift contractor admit the liability for delay so as to pay the limited amount of LD.
	- Option (ii)
		- Reasoned objection
			- Quoting relevant MC provisions regarding nomnation of sub-contractor and pointing out that the MC could object if the sub-contractor's liability towards the MC is not compatible with the MC's liability towards the Employer.
		- Workable counter proposal
			- The Employer to accept the shortfalls in LD
			- Make the lift contract as a direct contract

## Question

- **4.1 Unreasonable Rates**
	The basement construction contract for a project originally required the installation of 10 rock anchors at the south corner of the site. The tenderer priced for the rock anchors at half the normal price, but this was missed by the Quantity Surveyor during tender checking.
	
	The Contractor has now been instructed to install 100 rock anchors to all adjoining slopes abutting the basement excavation. The installation of the additional rock anchors will be on the critical path.
	
	The Quantity Surveyor has had discussions with the Contractor over the phone, and the Quantity Surveyor has pointed out that some court cases in recent years have ruled that unreasonable rates by themselves do not constitute grounds for requesting a new rate for pricing an increase/decrease in quantities of the same item of work.
	
	**Option (i) answered as the Contractor's QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to the Architect giving all possible arguments for reasonable compensation of the actual costs.
	
	**Option (ii) answered as the Consultant QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to the Employer to explain the legal position and the circumstances under which the Employer could consider the Contractor's claim for reasonable compensation of the actual costs.

- **4.2 Liquidated Damages**
	The Main Contract Works are divided into two phases for completion. Phase 1 was completed 5 months late, and Phase 2 is in progress. The Architect has granted an extension of time of 1 month to Phase 1 and considers that the remainder of the delay was the Main Contractor's responsibility. The Architect has certified the extended completion date, and the Employer has deducted liquidated damages accordingly.
	
	The Nominated M&E Sub-contractor has submitted a prolongation claim during the course of the Works but has so far not received any payment in respect of his claim because the Main Contractor is alleging that the Sub-Contractor is also liable for the delay. The Sub-Contractor is pressing for a meeting with all parties concerned.
	
	**Option (i) answered as the Sub-contractor's QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to be sent to the Architect prior to the meeting to request him to step in to resolve the impasse between the Main Contractor and your company, quoting where appropriate relevant clauses from the Standard Forms of Main Contract and Sub-Contract in use on the project. You should also advise the Architect what action should be taken and the impact if action is not taken.
	
	**Option (ii) answered as the Consultant QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to be sent to the Architect prior to the meeting to advise him of his obligations under the relevant clauses of the Standard Forms of Main Contract and Sub-Contract in use on the project, any other constructive actions to be taken, and the implications if action is not taken.

- **4.3 Inclement Weather**
	The Architect has granted an extension of time for delays caused by variations ordered.
	
	During the extended period (i.e., the period between the original date for completion and the extended date for completion), a further delay was caused by inclement weather. Under the Conditions of Contract, inclement weather is not one of the causes of delay for which the Architect may grant an extension of time.
	
	The Contractor has notified his intention to claim for an extension of time, together with the associated prolongation cost, in respect of the delay caused by the inclement weather occurring during the extended period.
	
	**Option (i) answered as the Contractor's QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to the Architect to further justify the validity of the time and cost claim.
	
	**Option (ii) answered as the Consultant QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to the Employer to advise whether the time and cost claim is in order.

- **4.4 Supplemental Agreement**
	You are the Consultant QS in charge of a large-scale office project in Tsim Sha Tsui. The project is in delay due to the following:
	
	(a) 2 months delayed handover of Section 2 of the site to the Main Contractor due to problems with piles installed by the piling contractor under a previous contract;  
	(b) 4 weeks delay in structural work caused by inclement weather for which there is no extension of time entitlement under the Contract;  
	(c) 10 weeks delay caused by non-performance of the HVAC Nominated Sub-Contractor, the said Sub-Contract was recently terminated by the Main Contractor with the Employer's consent, and it is anticipated that the renomination of a suitable replacement sub-contractor would take about 8 weeks.
	
	The Main Contractor has submitted claims for extension of time and costs in respect of all of the above events.
	
	The Employer now wants to add a penthouse floor to the building under construction after the lifting of the Airport Height Restriction. He also wants to secure handover of the mall from the ground floor to the 4th floor two months before the completion date of the overall contract for early fitting out by the buyer of these retail floors. Both the Employer and the Main Contractor want to settle the issues amicably and cover all matters in a supplemental agreement.
	
	Draft an agreement in the form of a letter for the parties to consider and agree to the settlement details.

- **4.5 Early Payment Cut-off in View of Potential Delay and L.D.**
	The progress of the project has been delayed by over 6 months, and the liability for the delay is not agreed between the parties. As reported by the Architect, the delay was mainly caused by the Contractor's problems.
	
	The contract should be completed in two phases. Completion of Phase 1 should be due on 1st October 2000, and the L.D. rate applicable is $200,000 per day. Completion of Phase 2 is due 12 months after completion of Phase 1 with the same level of L.D.
	
	Two big sums of money have been included in the payment certificate due to be honoured next week. They are for marble for Phase 2 with a value of $25,000,000 and chillers for Phase 2 with a value of $20,000,000 delivered by the Main Contractor and the MVAC Nominated Sub-Contractor respectively.
	
	The Employer intends to deduct L.D. for the expected delay to completion of Phase 1. He is also worried that, as the current progress on site is very slow, the amount certified in the October payment would be relatively small and there would be little available for L.D. deduction. Hence, he wants to hold back the payment for the marble and chillers now.
	
	**Option (i) answered as the Consultant QS:**
	
	Draft a letter to the Employer to advise him of his rights and the recommended course of action.
	
	**Option (ii) answered as the Contractor's QS:**
	
	You have received a letter from the Employer stating that they are withholding the payment because of your delay. Draft a letter to the Employer to advise whether he is right or wrong.
## Assessor Notes

- 4.1
	- Henry Boot Construction Ltd v Alstom Combined Cycles Ltd. "The work is not executed under dissimilar conditions simply because the applicable rate may result in the Contractor being paid markedly more or less than that which might be regarded as "fair", e.g. more or less than actual or reasonble costs plus profit and overheads". In other words, the fact tha ta rate or price which would otherwise be applicable may be considered too high or too low is completely immaterial.
	- The rule established by the recent court cases appear to be a deviation from the usual practice of QS. It was usually believed that a contractor should bear the consequence of his errors in agreeing the Contract Sum, and that neither contract parties should benefit from the undeniable errors by way of substantial omission or addition variations beyond reasonable range. A re-rate of absurdly over-period or under-priced rates would be considered.
	- Option (i) Arguments for reasonable compensation of the actual costs
		- Rate adjustments to be made because of execessively extra quantities should no longer be considered as work under "similar character or executed under similar conditions"
		- Different working sequence
		- More preparation work on slope
		- Disruption costs arising because work on critical path and extra quantities require longer time
		- Need to accelerate
		- The context of the court decision is not applicable to the present case
	- Option (ii)
		- Legal position
		- Permissible circumstances
			- The unit rates are really inadequate to cover costs
			- Increased quantities will cause loss to the Contractor beyond his reasonable contemplation
			- The Contractor should only be expected to bear the consequence of his errors in agreeing the Contract Sum, but not the consequence of excessive variations beyond the control of the Contractor
			- Reasonable and prompt settlement will not defer the work which is on critical path
			- Practical and reasonable to accept a re-rate
- 4.2
	- Option (i)  & (ii)
		- Reasoned request for Architect to step in
			- Architect is obliged under the Sub-Contract to decide the time or extended time for completion of the Sub-Contract Works
			- When the time responsibility is determined, then the financial liability will naturally follows
			- Prolongation cost for Phase 1 can be separately dealt with from that for Phase 2
			- The Employer will be responsible for such part of the prolgonation costs caused by the Employer's delay to Phase 1 and the QS shall value accordingly
			- Contract clauses to be quoted
		- Advice on actions to be taken by the Architect
			- Determine the time responsibllity
			- Request the QS to value such part of the prolongation costs caused by the Employer's delay to Phase 1
			- Instruct the MC to resolve the difference between MC and NSC
			- Hold meetings attended by relevant parties to deal with the matter
			- Recommend the Employer or pay all reasonable costs of prolongation incurred by NSC as assessed by QS and deduct them from payments to MC (not in 2005 SFBC). NSC to give indemnity in case his case is not proven.
		- Impact if action is not taken
			- Insufficient cash flow to provide further materials and labour
			- Progress of Phase 2 will be affected beyond wish
- 4.3
	- Inclement weather is not one of the causes of delay for which the Architect may grant an EOT. It follows that if the Contractor claimed for EOT of time purely on the grounds of inclement weather, the claim would be rejected by the Architect.
	- However, the Contractor may argue that the delay arising from the inclement weather is in fact a consequential part of an earlier delay caused by reasons for which he could have EOT. Under such circumstances, the claim for EOT would be valid.
	- Whether the associated prolongation cost can be entertained would depend on whether the earlier primary delay was a delay with cost effect. 
- 4.4
	- Dealing with future requirements
		- Additional requiremments to be incorporated
			- Penthouse to be added
			- Earlier handover of mall from G/F to 4/F
		- Programme for new design
		- Acceptable for candidates to imagine some dates or leave them blank to be filled in
		- Cost and time implicatino of the additional requirements
		- Probably a new completion time schedule to be agreed
	- Setting past problems
		- New completion time scheudule deemed to include all previous EOT, with possible exception for delay due to re-nominaiton. A programme for re-nomination should be described
		- The way that the cost implication of past delays have been or is to be dealt with
		- Acceptable for candidates to imagine some figures or leave them blank to be filled in
	- Other considerations
		- Protection required
		- Effect on payment arrangement
		- Effect of LD
		- Effect on bond and insurance
		- All other original contract terms remain unchanged
- 4.5
	- Advising Employer
		- The payment certificate persumably has been presented to the Employer for payment
		- Payment certificates issued and presented must be honoured by the Employer, unless he has reasonable ground for set-off
		- The Employer may se-off LD provided the Architect has certified non-completion already
		- Apparently, the Architect has not done so, and he should do as soon as possible before the due date for honouring payment
		- The Contract may challenge that the Architect has not duly granted EOT. This is a risk that the Employer should be aware of
		- A less satisfactory solution is for the Architect to withdraw the payment certifiacte. The validity of such withdrawal is doubtful and some good reasons must be put forward for the withdrawal, for example, a serious error in the certificate. It may induce the Architect into liability
		- Withholding payment by ignoring the payment certificate is not a contractually proper option but may be a solution determined by commercial reasons. The MC main pursue the determination clause on default of payment. During this time, all proper contractual precedures should be caught up. The Employer should be aware that he may be liable for breach of contract.
	- Arguing against the Employer
		- Payment certificates issued and presented must be honoured by Empoyer as specified in Contract
		- Before Employer may set-off LD, the Architect must have certified non-completion. The Architect has not done so.
		- The delay was not actually caused by Contractor as explained in previous letters
		- EOT should have been granted by the Architect. Failure by the Architect to grant EOT will cause the time for completion to tbe at large
		- Withholding payment as certified by the Architect is a reason for determination of the employment of the Contractor under the Contract
		- Notice is hereby served that if the default is not stopped within the period sepcified in the determination clause in the Contract, the employment of the Contractor shall be determined.
		- Right to all loss and damages reserved

## Assessor Notes

- 1.1
	- Accuracy and basis of data
		- Standard budgetary rates are:-
			- Average rates for similar type of buildings
			- Intended for budgetary indications only
			- Irrespectice of location of site
			- Based on normal site conditions, foundations and programmes, etc which can be very different for different projects even of similar type
			- Without specific project design details, subject to adjustments for specific details of individual projects
			- Statistics based on historical data; published regularly but usually some time ago
			- Intended to be adjusted for changes in price levels with time
		- Detailed cost estimate is:-
			- Specifically prepared for the project in question, with due considerations for the specific details of the project
			- Prepared based on a more advanced level of project information
			- Prepared based on approxminate quantities with measurement and pricing
			- Based on current market rates
			- Possibly with some built-in buffer for future inflation
		- Therefore detailed cost estimate is more accurate and realistic for future use
	- Scope and provisions
		- Standard budgetary rates:-
			- Normally include only standard provisions in respect of design, finishes, fittings and services for public housing
			- Exclude clubhouse wihch may be under different cost centres
			- Exclude external works in this case
		- Detailed cost estimate has allowed for:-
			- The specific type of foundations appropriate for the development
			- A larger ratio of bathrooms per flat
			- Taller building
			- More interior fittings such as wardrobed, vanity counters, washing machines, refrigerators, ovens, kitchen equipment and cabinets, etc.
			- More M&E provisions such as compueter data outlets, central air-conditioning or split-type air-conditioning units, gas serviecs and heaters, lifts of higher speed
			- Clubhouse and extensive landscaping works
			- External works
	- Quality
		- Standard budgetary rates are for public housing projects which have the following characteristics leading to lower construction costs:-
			- Provision of fairly general quality of finishes and fittings e.g. sprayed paint to external walls, glazed tiling to bathroom and kitchen, cement sand plaster or rendering to ceiling, wall and floor finishes, etc.
			- Provision of less fancy entrance lobby, lift lobbies, lift car interiors
		- Detail cost estimate is for a private residential development with allowance for more expensive materials:-
			- Ceramic tiles, granite slab or cladding as external wall finishes
			- Granite or marble slabs/tile to bathrooms and kitchen
			- Luxurious quality of sanitary fittings and ironmongery
			- Maple or other high quality timber flooring, skirtings and pelmets, etc.
			- More decorative entrance lobby, lift lobbies, lift car interiors
		- Tradditionally public housing is low cost housing with standard of workmanship set at a lower standard than that for private residential developments
		- While public housing is subject to established supervision system, supervision of private residential flats can sometimes be more stringent due to the higher expectation of the flat purchasers
	- Construction method
		- Public housing projects represented by the standard budgetary rates normally have the following characteristics which lead to lower construction cost:-
			- Normally not exceeding 40 storey high and more than one block per project
			- Standarization in design and construction - repeated use of standard design and the building up of experience have enabled the standard design to be refined to be the most cost effective solution
			- Industrization - highly mechnised and industrialised in the production of materials and components; prefabrication of components and repetitive use of formwork are common
			- Use of contractor's available plant can be maximized with the large volumn of construction work
			- Economy of scale - large volumn of flats per project, large volumn of projects per year - all these will encourage bulk purchase / supply and bulk production
			- Contractors are all conversant with these projects - this reduces their uncertainties and risks
		- The building represented by the detailed cost estimate is:
			- A super-high-rise (55-storeys) building which on one hand calls for higher construction cost and on the other hand requires a longer construction programme
			- Of a specific deisng which does not have the characteristics of the public housing projects
			- As a result, cost more
	- Price levels
		- Public housing project represneted by the standard budgetary rates possess the following special features which lead to lower construction costs:-
			- Contractors are selected by open tendering with greater number of tenderers with higher possibility for low bid
			- The contract provisions are generally very standard and the terms are normally more reasonable and fair to contractors, e.g. lower level of LD
			- With government department as the Empoyer, there is very little risk of non-payment or delay in payment by the Employer
			- Fluctuation clauses are normally applied and contractors do not have to allow dor inflationary risks
		- The building represented by the detailed cost estimate does not possess such special features and hance higher tender price are expected
			- Contractors are to be selected via selective tendering and the competition is less fierce
			- Normally the standard form of building contracts is heavily amended in order that most risks are shifted to contracts who therefore have to allow for the same in the tender prices
			- Some clients do not like to pay promply and financial standing of clients are also the concern of contractors
			- Firm price contracts in lieu of price fluctuation contracts are used
			- As a result the tender price will become higher
- 1.2
	- Easy retrieval for both hard copies and computer files
		- MC and NSC to have meaningful naming or numbering system
		- Sections within a document to bear meaningful and universal prefix against page number
		- Computer files to be stored under systematic directory
		- Hard copies to bear systematic reference names and numbers
		- Suffix to be used to identify revised versions
		- Reference names and numbers to appear at convenient positions of documents
	- Consistent wording to avoid discrepancies and claims
		- A master copu to be maintained for all main contracts
		- The first MC can serve as the master copy
		- Draft of additional main contracts to follow the master copy
		- Similar principle to be adopted for NSC
		- While there should be a master copy for all NSC under the project, there may be a need for a sub-master copy for each group of NSC under a main contract since different MC may have different particulars of their own
		- Briefing session to be organized for newcomers to the team
		- Model bills to be used
	- Proper procedure for making changes
		- Subsequent changes to the drafts of any MC which are of significance and of general application to be approved by the project-in-charge and recorded in the master copy
		- Such changes to be communicated to other MC already prepared whether in draft or final stage
		- Other MC to be revised to suit if there are chances, otherwise the revisions to be noted for post contract administration
		- Similar principle to be adopted for NSC
	- Proper record of changes for both hard copies and computer files
		- Records to be kept of revisions made to any document
		- Written drafts to be kept
		- Where computer files are used and when the software is capable of recording the changes, use the capability
		- Copies of different versions of computer files to be kept
		- Different file names to be used to signify different versions of files
	- Easy identification of differences in hard copies
		- Documents to bear version number and/or version dates
		- File name bearing version/revision number to appear in hard copies
		- Font, typeface, page width, page breaks to be kept the same
		- Standard douments to be used, with changes represented by special documents to be used, with changes represented by special documents such as special conditions of contract, special preamables
		- Clause number to be maintained the same, use "not used" rather than adjusting the clause numbers
		- Changes to be highlighted
		- Words and symbols to be used to identify amended pages
- 1.3
	- Concept of VE _(2001 Q 1.3)_
	    - To review project-related design issues and compare the cost of such design with the value created to satisfy project objectives
	    - Reveal design alternatives which can result in cost saving or designs that may satisfy more than one project objective and create more value
	    - The benchmark for comparison of values often relates to cost, however, projects may have multiple objectives including time, phasing, environmental consciousness, costs-in-use, information technology awareness, flexibility in future use and capability for future expansion
	- Process of VE _(2001 Q 1.3)_
	    - Information phase
	        - Collect basic design information including design brief, preliminary drawings, site location, access, orientation, associated cost information and user requirements
	    - Analysis phase
	        - Identify the 'needs' and 'wants' including project objectives
	    - Creativity phase
	        - Brainstorming session to gather ideas on how the project objectives can be achieved without relating these ideas to the costs
	    - Development phase
	        - Develop the ideas collected from the creativity phase, assess the feasibility in terms of practicality, building code violation
	    - Evaluation and recommendation
	        - Evaluate each idea in terms of cost, time for implication, limitations in design
	        - Come up with a list of recommended issues for future follow-up action
	- Parties _(2001 Q 1.3)_
	    - Employer, Architect, Structural Engineer, M&E Engineer, Quantity Surveyor, building management team, users
	- Role of QS _(2001 Q 1.3)_
	    - Provide advice on monetary value of design alternative
	    - Employer to judge whether the money spent is justified for the value derived from the design alternatives
	- Role of facilitator & candidate *(2001 Q 1.3)*
		- Allocate sufficient time for each process of VE
		- Encourage the view of all disciplines be represented
		- Candidate
			- Should have the training 
			- No particular discipline
			- QS more suited because QS are cost conscious and all design decisions will have some effect on costs. QS are basically neutral in terms of design perference as long as the design can achieve the most economic outcome. The all-round training of QS enables a wider consideration of the needs of users and operatprs and will objectively provoke more balanced views from the participants of the VE.
- 1.4
	- Itemised price breakdown
		- Three prices with qty and rates to be submitted
		- Spalling concrete & scaffolding to be priced separately or described as included in other measured itesm
		- Some separate items are expected for preliminaries but they are not expected to be exhaustive
	- Essential contract terms
		- Contract period
		- Working hours
		- Site storage space
		- Water and electricity
		- Insurance
		- Terms of payment
		- Tender validity
		- Bond is not expected
		- Other more detailed terms are not expected
	- Comparative cost study
		- Reasonable estaimte of the costs of repair to be given
		- Costs incurred at different times to be brought to a common base by means of a quantitative treatment of inflaction and devaluation of money or, if inflation of repair costs is assumed to off-set devaluation of money, a qualitative account of such assumption
		- Cost to include both first renovation and subsequent repair costs
		- Major repairs of large mosaic tiling and screed 15 years after first renovation should not be envisaged
- 1.5
	- Site inspection
		- Site location, access, access restrictions, width, bearing capacity, pubilc transport
		- Existing features, vegetation, construction, obstructions
		- Adjoining properties, conditions, adjoining owners, interference, nuisance

## Question

- **Sub-Question 2.1: Civil Engineering and Building Contract Forms**
	You are the Consultant QS for a very complex building development project which also involves substantial site formation, retaining structures, roads, bridges, subways, and a private reservoir. A project manager within the Client's project management team is a civil engineer by profession. He advocates the use of civil engineering contract forms for the whole project. The Client's project director has sought your comment and advice on the difference in principle between the usual civil engineering and building contract forms with respect to the works to be carried out. Draft a letter to the project director to cover the following:
	
	(a) Differences in terminology;  
	(b) Differences in contract administrator and contract administration;  
	(c) Differences in basis for initial and final prices;  
	(d) Risk sharing principles; and  
	(e) Choice between the civil engineering and building contract forms for this project.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

- **Sub-Question 2.2: Piling Tenders**
	You are the Consultant QS for a new development in the New Territories. The site is located in an area where the underground conditions are known to be very complex. However, as part of the land is still under occupation, very limited site investigation can be carried out before the start of the piling contract. As requested by your Client, draft a letter to advise him on the following matters:
	
	(a) (about 5) Pros/cons relating to the use of a design-and-build contract based on loading schedules as compared to a contract based on the Engineer's design;  
	(b) (about 4) Factors, other than the cost of the piles themselves, to be considered when comparing tenders for design-and-build contracts based on loading schedules;  
	(c) (about 2) Pros/cons relating to pricing of remeasurement/variations based on the actual numbers of piles irrespective of the actual lengths of piles as compared to that based on the actual numbers and lengths of piles; and  
	(d) Your recommended choice of contract type and remeasurement/variation method for the present project.
	
	Total 10 marks: 40% marks for (a), 20% marks each for (b) to (d)

- **Sub-Question 2.3: Direct Contracts for Materials Supply**
	You are a Consultant QS. A Client is considering whether he should himself procure the major materials for construction. He considers that by taking out the material costs, the Contractor would not mark up profits and overheads on the material costs. Draft a letter to him to:
	
	(a) Explain whether his concept is correct or not;  
	(b) Further explain whether his intended arrangement is desirable or not; and  
	(c) Whether there are better alternatives.
	
	Total 10 marks: 30% marks for (a), 50% marks for (b), 20% marks for (c)

- **Sub-Question 2.4: Tendering**
	You are a Consultant QS. Tenders for a main contract for construction on a difficult site have been returned. One tenderer declined to tender and another tenderer withdrew his tender after tendering. Fortunately, there are still sufficient tenders, but they all have different qualifications and incomplete technical submissions. Draft a letter to the Architect to:
	
	(a) Suggest (about 5) possible measures to prevent a tenderer from declining to tender after collecting the tender documents;  
	(b) Suggest (about 2) additional measures to prevent a tenderer from withdrawing his tender after submission of his tender;  
	(c) Advise whether a heavy penalty is desirable for the above two situations and give reasons;  
	(d) Suggest the major considerations in prioritizing the order in which the tenderers are to be interviewed; and  
	(e) Prepare an agenda for the tenderers' interview meetings, assuming that no clarification questionnaires will be issued to the tenderers before the interviews.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

- **Sub-Question 2.5: High and Low Tender Rates**
	You are a Consultant QS. According to the practice of your company, unreasonably high or low tender rates will be communicated to the tenderers during the tender assessment stage. Draft a paper with reference to lump sum firm quantities contracts to:
	
	(a) Explain the details and purpose of such practice;  
	(b) Explain whether there would be any difference in treatment for provisional quantities within a firm BQ tender, for complete provisional BQ tenders, and for schedule of rates-only remeasurement tenders;  
	(c) Explain the significance of such practice in the light of court cases in recent years which decided that contract rates are sacred;  
	(d) Explain how you would judge a rate to be unreasonably high or low; and

		- Contractor's liability to search
		- Extension of time for inclement weather
		- Extension of time due to speical circumstances
		- Dispute resolution
	- Choice between civil and building contract forms for this project
		- Who will be in charge of contract administration?
		- Which contract forms are they familiar with?
		- Are there a lot of unpreditable risks which a particular form is more suitable to deal with as compared to the other?
		- Are the sub-contract forms suitblae?
- 2.2
	- Pros / cons of D&B contracts
		- Contractor's expertise, specialization and special plant may be utilized
		- Contractor's taking the risks and benefits of alternative design
		- Contractor's design will be less conservative than Engineer's design
		- Price competition may force the safety or risks margin and contractor's design to an unreasonably low level
		- Contractor may cut corners if their less conservative design proves to be inadequate
		- Tendering would have to be earlier in order allow time for Gov submission
		- Variations will be less welcome and more difficult to evaluate if the basis of contractor's tender design is substantially changed, i.e. employer have less control on design and freedom to change
		- Sufficient soil investigation report should be available for a confortable price
		- Tendering costs are higher for tenderers
	- Factors to be considered when comparing D&B tender price
		- Costs of pile caps
		- Time to complete after contract award including design and submissions
		- Costs of the employer's supervision
		- Technical merits
		- Liability for Gov procedures
		- Environmental impacts
		- Safety requirements
		- Tenderer's experience
		- Quality of design services provided by tenderers
	- Pros / cost of remeasurement / variation irrespective of the actual lengths of piles
		- Simpler
		- Contractor's taking the risks and benefits in regard to the lengths of the piles. Risks may eventually turn out to be too high for contractors to take or the benfits too good for employers to regret
		- Not suitable for final account if the locations of the piles are varied to a very different soild and rock conditions, making the rate per pile not applicable
	- Recommended choice
		- Lack of sufficient soil data
		- Contractor's risk
		- Variation pricing method
- 2.3
	- Validity of E's concept to save P&O
		- Profits and overheads are usually marked up as a percentage of the costs of construction inclusive of labour, materials and plant
		- The profits and overheads recovered from a contract should be able to cover its share of the actual overheads and expected profits of the company for the same period
		- If portion of the material costs is taken out, the percentage markup has to be increased in order to give the same amount of profits and overheads
		- There would be no saving in profits and overheads
		- There may be saving in profits and overheads due to other reasons, such as reduced administrative costs of procurement, reduced risks in materials supply and quality
	- Desirability of E's intended arrangement
		- Not desirable from the point of view of reducing mark-ups for profits and overheads
		- Desirable if E has better bulk purchasing or bargaining power than C
		- Less desirable because E and consultants would incur higher administrative costs
		- Less desirable since E is taking up risks of timely delivery and material quality
		- More desirable for enumerated items which can be quantified precisely such as sanitary fittings, doors and ironmongery
		- Less desirable for items which involve less precise quantification, involve wastage calculations and are more easily affected by variations, such as tiles, cement, reinforcement
	- Any better alternatives
		- Nominated supply contracts 
		- Standing offers by pre-selected suppliers for tenderers to choose as domestic supply
		- PC rate arrangement with standing offers by selected suppliers as domestic supply
- 2.4
	- Tenderers' declining to tender
		- Enquire prospective tenderers before tendering to seek show of interest in tendering
		- Provide more information of project and contract during the enquiry to enable the prospective tenderers to judge
		- Give advice of no prejudice to future tendering prospect if declining the invitation
		- Given warning of bad records if declining to tender after invitation
		- Tenderers to give early reply if they reaaly cannot tender after invitation
		- Do not require tenderers to incur excessive tendering costs such as requiring them to measure BQ for complex projects
		- Require higher tender deposites which will be forefeited if genuine tenders are not submitted after collection
		- Reasonable tendering preparation time for tenderer
	- Tenderer's withdrawing tenders
		- Tender information to be kept strictly confidential to avoid leakage of information
		- Bid bond to be submitted
		- Deposit by tenderers of cash security, in lieu of a bid bond
		- Tender as a firm standing offer which cannot be withdrawn, possibly with a nominal consideration given by the Employer
		- The above measures may not be very effective if tender query amounts to a counter-offer. Tender query may also have a side effect of giving tenderers a soft excuse for moderating their tender prices
	- Desirability of heavy penalty
		- Tenderers should be looking for business. They must have genuine reasons if they chose to decline or withdraw. The reasons might be due to sudden change in workload, financial capability, resources and underpricing
		- Heavy penalty with a view to force unwilling or incapable contractors to take up the contract will create problems with post contract
		- Tenderers will quote cover prices more often when faced with heavy penalty
	- Prioritizing tender interviews
		- Tenderers with higher or less attrative tenders to be interviewed first so that matters arising can be discussed with the lowest or most attractive tenderer more thoroughly
		- This order to be slightly adjusted if tenderers are interviewed on consecutive sessions to void tenderers from knowing their relative positions
	- Agenda for the interview
		- Introduction of parties and persons present
		- Confirmation of tender prices and contract period
		- Presentation of proposed site organization
		- Presentation of proposed programme
		- Presentation of proposed method statement and site layout
		- Clarification of tender qualifications
		- Clarification of arithmetical errors
		- Clarification of unreasonable rates and prices
		- Clarification of project expectation or objectives
		- Clarification of difficult contract terms or specification requirements
		- Announcement of additional or varied requirements
		- Any other business
		- Time for reply
- 2.5
	- Purpose
		- As a general principle, variations should be priced at reasonable rates
		- Unreasonably high rates will be unfavourable to E when additional qty of work are required, on the other hand, unreasonably low rates will be unfavourable to C when qty of work are reduced
		- Unreasonable rates might be due to mistakes or made intentionally
		- Unreasonable rates made by mistake should not be allowed to propagate to the post contract. Whether errors made in tendering would have benefited or penalised the contract parties with the acceptance of the tender and should therefore not be allowed to repeat again
	- Detail
		- Agreement of reasonable rates to substitute would help solve the problem
		- Unreasonably high or low rates are picked out and communicated to tenderers together with suggestions of reasonable rates for their acceptance for the purposes of pricing variations whether they be omissions or additions. The tender sum shall remain unchanged
		- Even if tenderers do not agree to change, they would still be required to confirm that they would abide by the unreasonable rates for future purposes
	- Treatment for provisional qty, provisional BQ and SOR
		- Provisional qty
			- Since the contract sum is still accepted on a lump sum basis, the same principle should apply, i.e. the added or reduced portion only will be priced at reasonable rates while unreasonable rates will still by used for pricing original provisional qty
		- Provisional BQ
			- If the provisional total price is view as a 'lump sum' for the purpose of tender selection, then the same principle should apply
			- If the individual unit rates are view as of greater importance than the provisional total price, then the reasonable rates should be used for pricing the whole of the remeasured qty.  It would be better to adjust the provisional total price to incorporate the reasonable rates to reflect the more realistic total and to avoid two rates to co-exist for remeasurement.
		- SOR
			- The unit rates are more important and there are no original qty, the reasonable unit rates should be used for pricing the whole of the remeasured qty
		- Some gov dept tend not to re-agree rates
		- Some org adopt the reasonable rates for additional qty only, with unreasonable rates still being used for pricing the original qty or omission therefrom, whether the original qty be firm or provisional
	- Implication of court case
		- Traditionally, QS would exercise discretion to allow adjustment of incorrect contract rates for variation purposes if he considers the application of the incorrect contract rates unfair
		- Some recent court cases appear to have cast doubt or put restrictions on such discretionary power
		- Therefore it is important for QS to spot out the incorrect unit rates before contract award and follow the practice described above
	- Judging high or low rates
		- Compare amongst the tender rates to pick out rates with greater deviations from the others
		- Deviations of 20% or 50% may not be unreasonable in some cases. Deviations of over 100% should receive particular attention
		- Beware that there are cases that all except the odd ones are wrong
		- Rates from estimates or from other projects are useful for comparison
		- Rates should be adequate to cover prime cost rates or material costs as a minimum
		- Incorrect rates are easier to judge than unreasonable rates
	- Communicating low rates also
		- Unreasonably low rates left in contract untouched will be unfavourable to the Employer in case of omission of the relevant items
		- If by description an unreasonably priced low item has to be used for assessing pro-rata rate for a new item, the pro-rata rate so calculated would be distorting or unrealistic, and would be unfair for a new item
		- The tender sum would be required to remain unchanged even though low rates are communicated. Therefore, E would not lose

	(d) Quantity Surveyor's issues; and  
	(e) Main Contractor's issues.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

- **Sub-Question 3.2: Terms of Payments**
	The normal regular progress payments in construction contracts are based on actual work done and materials delivered without deposit payments. Some trades or sectors of the construction-related industries adopt stage payments. Some people call this milestone payments. The Construction Industry Review Committee, commissioned by the Government, recommended wider use of milestone payments over normal regular progress payments. A special form of stage/milestone payments is to split the Works into a number of activities, each with a value, which will be included in the payment valuation only when that particular activity is complete by a regular payment valuation date; otherwise, no portion of that value will be paid.
	
	With reference to the above-mentioned methods of interim payment, namely (i) deposit payments, (ii) stage payments, and (iii) time-related milestone payments, explain:
	
	(a) The mechanism of including these payments in interim payments;  
	(b) The usual/appropriate situations for their use;  
	(c) The risks and problems involved in using these methods of payment;  
	(d) Possible solutions to alleviate the risks and problems; and  
	(e) The pros and cons relating to these methods of payment as compared to the normal regular progress payments.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

- **Sub-Question 3.3: Payment for Materials**
	You are the Consultant QS for a contract for the construction of a single 30-storey residential tower block. The project is in the 10th month of its 18-month contract period. The following is an extract from the Contract Bills:
	
	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250331132529.png)
	The Contractor's payment application No. 10, which is yet to be processed, contains a claim for the value of materials on site for the ceramic tiles, backed up by delivery notes and quotations from their suppliers as follows:
	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250331132544.png)
	Recent site inspection shows that external wall tiling to the Ground Floor is 75% complete and grouted, whereas the external tiling to the typical floors of the tower from 1st floor upwards is up to the 6th floor, but grouting only up to the 4th floor.
	
	You have obtained the following material cost information:
	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250331132609.png)
	
	Workout the value of work done for the external wall tiles, and the value of materials on site for the wall tiles for the purpose of preparing your recommendation for payment for application No. 10. Throughout your workings, give notes to illustrate the principles of valuing materials on site in respect of:
	
	(a) Premature delivery;  
	(b) Wastage;  
	(c) Acceptability of Contractor's suppliers' quotations;  
	(d) Effect of BQ rates on value payable for materials on site; and  
	(e) Finally, arrive at the value.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

A Nominated Sub-Contractor for a (building or civil) contract handled by you has submitted a request directly to the Employer for payment for prefabricated materials stored off-site in his yard in the PRC which are ready for delivery. There is no contractual provision for off-site payment. There is a rumor that the Sub-Contractor is not financially very sound. As requested by the Employer, draft a letter to him to advise on:
	
	(a) His risks if he agrees to pay direct  
	(b) His risks if he does not agree to pay direct  
	(c) Common actions no matter whether direct payment is made or not  
	(d) Suggestions on securing his best interests if he agrees to pay as requested  
	(e) Alternative arrangements in lieu of paying as requested
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (e)

- 3.2
	- Mechanism
		- Deposit payment
			- A portion of Contract Sum is paid upon the award of the Contract as a security of the Contract and to facilitate the Contractor to procure materials and to cover his early expenses. 
			- Some contracts specify that in case of repudiation of the Contract by the Employer, the deposit is to be forfeited, and in case of repudiation by the Contractor, the Contractor has to refund the deposit in double.  
			- Recovery of the deposit payments in subsequent payments is usually pro-rata to the progress value of work done and materials delivered
		- Stage payment
			- The Works are broken down into a number of stages of completion each with a value which will be paid on completion of the relevant stage of the Works
		- Time-related milestone payment
			- The Works are broken into a number of activities each with a value which will be included in payment valuation only when that particular activity is complete by a regular payment valuation date otherwise no portion of that value will be paid. The time factor is an important element in making payments
	- Application
		- Deposite payment
			- Usually for sales contacts, lift and escalator contractors, fitting out contracts, minor contracts
			- Appropriate for contracts which involve substantial up-front expenditure before materials are delivered to site
		- Stage payments
			- Usually for sales contracts, lift and escalator contracts, fitting out contracts, contracts for single block speculative residential building, minor contracts, civil engineering contracts
			- Appropriate for contracts which can have easily defined stages of completion of the Works, for contracts which are of simple nature, for contracts which the Contract Administrator would not like to spend time to value the quantities of work and materials delivered on regular basis
		- Time-related milestone payment
			- Usually for ASD design and build, MTRC, AA and civil engineering contract
			- Appropriate for contracts when the progress of the Works is of utmost importance
	- Risks and problems
		- Deposit payment
			- Overpayment from the point of view of the Employer, possibly under the end of the Contract depending on the terms of recovering the deposits in subsequent payments
		- Stage payment
			- If the definitions of the stages are too rigid, literal interpretation of the definitions may require in non-achievement of the stages and hence non-payment. 
			- If the definitions of the stages are too vague, there might be dispute on interpretation
			- If the definitions are too loose, the Contractor may take advantage to do work just enough to match the definitions while the value assigned for the stage may in fact have already allowed for greater extent of work. 
			- Substantial changes in the sequencing of thee Works may disturb the original logic of the terms of the stage payments
		- Time-related payment
			- Same problem as stage payments if the definition of the activities are too rigid or too loose. 
			- Stages in stage payments usually run consecutively while activities in time-related milestone payments may run concurrently. 
			- The activies as defined before tendering without the Contractor;s input may not be realistic when compared to the Contractor's intended sequence of work after contract award. 
			- If there is any futher critical variation to the Works or serious disruption to the original programme and logic such that the definitions of the activities can no longer be achievable or can only be achieved until the very late stage of the Works, payments will be seriously deffered.
	- Risks and problems
		- Deposit payment
			- Amount of surety bond to be increased to cover the deposit payments
			- Advance payment bond to be provided by the contractors as security for deposit payments
			- Rate of recovery of deposit payments in subsequent payments to be quicker than percentage of work done
			- Recovery of deposit payments in subsequent payments to be related to time rather than to percentage of work done
		- Stage payment
			- Definitions to be realistic with margin for interpretation
			- Minimize post contract changes
			- In case the cumulative total of stage payments deviates from the value based on work done and materials delivery by a certain percentage then payments will be based on the latter
		- Time-related payment
			- Same as stage payments
			- Miimize concurrent activities when devising the payment terms
	- Pros and cons as comparde to the normal regular progress payments
		- Deposit payment
			- Advantageous to contractors
			- Overpayment from E's point of view
			- Necessary to secure small contractors or specialist
		- Stage payment
			- Simple to opearte if not subjected to employer's changes or contractor's abuse
			- Not suitable for complex projects which are prone to design and programe changes
		- Time-related payment
			- Stone emphasis on achievemen tin relation to time and greater commitment from contractors towards time
			- Substantial design and programme changes may render the original terms of payments not workable and require revisions which may be too frequent and labourious that the original intent to save work in carrying out normal valuation based on works done and materials delivery is no longer realized
- 3.3
	- Premature delivery
		- Materials delivered prematurely not payable
		- Reasoning in judging whether there is premature delivery to be given
		- The fact that a material has to be purchased and delivered all in one lot is not good enought for being excused from judgment of premature delivery
		- Prompt delivery in accordance with the original programme without regard to the actual progerss may still be a premature delivery
		- For a project as a whole, the percentage of total materials delivered should be in a very rough sense slightly bigger than the percentage of the realistic overall contract period elapsed. However, this would not be the case for a particular material. For a particular material, the percentage delivered should bear relationship to the percentage of realistic time elapsed for the relevant work using that material, not the time elapsed for the whole contract
		- The quantities of materials left to be fixed and the time over which such outstanding quantities are to be fixed should be the better criteria for judging whether delivery is mature enough for payment
	- Wastage
		- Wastage to be alloed for when considering supply quantities
		- Flat wastage factor acceptable as a quick method
		- Different wastage factors used for different items of work, depending on the difficulty of work
	- Acceptability of Contractor's supplier's quotations
		- Quotations not necessarily contracts
		- Beware of false quotations and contracts
		- Counter-check required
	- Effect of BQ rates on value payable of MOS
		- Upon analysis of the material supply rates, the contract rates were under-priced
		- In case of under-priced all-in rates, should the material costs payable be in full, or be a proportion of the all-in rates, or be limited to the costs after deducting the costs to complete?
	- Arrive at the value
		- Systematic, clear, reasonable factors, arithmetially correct calculations
- 3.4
	- Employer's risks for paying direct
		- NSC going bankrupt or disappearing after receiving payment
		- NSC not delivering after payment
		- Possession and title not yet secured by NSC before payment
		- Possession and tile not yet secured by Employer before payment
		- Property not properly passed form NSC to MC to Employer
		- Materials not up to standard or quality
		- Loss or damage after payment
	- Employer's risk if not paying direct
		- NSC going slow - this will be MC's risks 
		- NSC going bankrupt or disappearing
		- Re-nomination with all consequential delays and costs to the Employer
		- MC taking advantage of the situation to cover his delays and defaults
	- Common actions no matter whether payment is made or not
		- Check financial standing of NSC
		- Check status of bond submitted by NSC
		- Check status of payment to NSC, whether over-payment or substantial under-payment
		- Evaluate the programme implication
		- Source alternative NSC just in case
	- Suggestion if paying as requested
		- Adopt the procedures and measures as in SFBC
		- Check materials in PRC yard for quality and quantities
		- Check with NSC's suppliers and manufactures the status of their payments and title
		- Evaluate NSC's ability to complete the work after further payments
		- Obtain MC's agreement to pay direct
		- Transfer the materials to stores under the control of the Employer or the MC, if he agrees
		- Obtain personal guarantees from shareholders or directors of NSC 
	- Alternative arrangements in lieu of paying as requested
		- Pay only after delivery to Hong Kong, not necessarily the Site
		- Make arrangement to pay NSC's suppliers and manufactures direct in order to secure title
		- If the shareholders or parent or affiliated companies are still financially sound, make the payment in the form of a loan to such shareholders or parent or affiliated companies
- 3.5
	- First payment format and procedure
		- Set up payment valuation pro-forma
		- Pro-forma to be covered from BQ
		- Change BQ file into a file format capable of doing calculations, such as EXCEL, if not already in such file format
		- If QS software is used for BQ and payment valuation, facilitate the Contractor to use the same software
		- Group BQ items into suitable groups (e.g. under sub-headings) to reduce the items to be valued
		- Valuation to be based on percentages rather than based on absolute quantities
		- Valuation to be based on gross value to-date rather than based on nett value since last payment
		- Discuss with the Contractor to agree format and procedure
		- Agree with the Contractor the principle and calculation methods for paying preliminaries
		- Running totals to be kept for material delivery
		- AI as authority for paying variations
	- Final payment re-requisites
		- Settlement of final account
		- Settlement of EOT and LD
		- Certificate of Defects Rectification
		- Submission of proof of previous payments to NSC
		- Submission of warranties and guarantees
		- Submission of as-built records

## Question

- **Sub-Question 4.1 Site investigation report**  
	You are a Contractor's QS. Your company has undertaken a design and build piling contract based on loading schedules provided by the Architect with a fixed contract period inclusive of Building Authority’s approval and consent on design and construction. A site investigation report was provided by the Architect during tendering for reference only, with no guarantees as to its accuracy or applicability over the whole site. Boreholes done pursuant to a condition of approval of piling design by the Building Authority revealed that the rock levels encountered on site were much shallower than those indicated in the site investigation report. Though some savings could be achieved by using shorter piles, the Building Authority now requires re-checking and justification of the piling design and construction before giving consent to commencement of piling. This would result in a longer contract period with exposure to a huge amount of liquidated damages. Make reasonable assumptions and draft a persuasive letter to the Architect to reduce the burden of liquidated damages.
	
	Total 10 marks

- **Sub-Question 4.2 Cash flow forecasts**  
	You are a QS in a developer organization, which has used both in-house QS and external consultant QS to handle projects. The Director of Finance has complained to your QS department that the overall cash flow forecast submitted by your department for projects in hand during the construction stage has been incorrect again. Draft a memo to the Director of Finance to:
	
	(a) Give (about 10) reasons for the inaccuracy in cash flow forecasts; and  
	(b) Suggest 5 measures which can be used to improve the accuracy of the cash flow forecasts.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) and (b)

- **Sub-Question 4.3 Determination**  
	You are the Consultant QS for a construction (building or civil) project. The employment of the Contractor has just been determined by the Employer due to the Contractor's suspension of the Works. Please explain your special duties and special considerations in performing such duties after the determination in respect of:
	
	(a) Survey on re-entry;  
	(b) Other immediate actions;  
	(c) Completing the Works;  
	(d) State the principles and methods of calculating the Employer's claim against the Contractor, listing all the cost headings to be included in the statement of claims.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (d)

- **Sub-Question 4.4 Defects**  
	You are a QS in a developer's organization, which owns a portfolio of leased properties. Your estate management colleagues have recently written an internal memorandum to you about defects found in one of the leased service apartment buildings.
	
	The building was certified as practically completed 13 months ago and tenants moved in 3 months after completion. After a severe rainstorm that happened 11 months after practical completion, there were complaints from the tenants about water seepage through windows. The result of this seepage was damage to internal wallpaper as well as tenants' properties. Your estate management department has notified the Contractor of the damage to the building and tenants' properties, and has asked the Contractor to come back to rectify. Though the balance of the retention is still not released, the Contractor's response, however, has been defensive and negative. He has either denied responsibility or delayed taking action. No remedial action has yet been taken up to now.
	
	As the tenants are increasingly discontented, your estate management department is eager to have the rectification work carried out immediately, and suggests the same to be carried out by another contractor who is now working on another building contract for your Company.
	
	Draft a memo to the estate management colleagues to advise them on the following:
	
	(a) Your Company's rights and obligations under the construction contract in respect of the reported damage to the building;  
	(b) Your Company's rights and obligations under the construction contract in respect of the reported damage to the tenants' properties;  
	(c) Pros and cons relating to immediate engagement of the other contractor;  
	(d) Necessary actions to be taken before, during, and after the rectification if the same is proceeded with as suggested by the estate management department.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (d)

- **Sub-Question 4.5 Fraudulent records**  
	You will give a speech to the undergraduates in your mother university on the fraudulent fabrication of records concerning bored piling and other underground construction in the past two years. Draft the speech to give:
	
	(a) Your opinion on the possible causes of such malpractice;  
	(b) Your suggestions for pre-contract measures to address the problem;  
	(c) Your suggestions for post-contract measures to address the problem;  
	(d) Your suggestions for measures outside the construction contracts to address the problem.
	
	Total 10 marks: equal marks for (a) to (d)

## Assessor Notes

- 4.1
	- Whether the accuracy of the site investigation report can be completely denied by the Employer is not a legally settled question
	- Inadequate time or impossibility such as demolition in progress during tendering to verify the accuracy of the site investigation
	- Site investigation reports from adjoining areas indicated that the Architect's site investigation report was consistent with them
	- Even though its applicability over the whole site is not guaranteed, the Architect's site investigation report must bear a reasonable degree of accuracy in respect of those locations investigated
	- It is reasonable for the Contractor to reply upon the Architect's site investigation report
	- Subsequent boreholes show that the Architect's site investigation report was not accurate even for those locations investigated
	- The Architect's site investigation report amounts to a misrepresentation
	- The BA's requirement to review its previous approval is too stringent. The Architect has not exercised due diligence to argue with the BA to waive this requirement
	- The Contractor has done proper procedures after contract award. The present requirements for re-approval by BA could not be within the contemplation of the Contractor at the time of tendering and could not have been allowed for in the Contract in terms of time or costs 
	- Other contractors appointed to do the job would face the same problem
	- Suggest to granite EOT with LD and prolongation costs waived by both parties
- 4.2
	- Reasons for inaccuracy
		- Time
			- Programmes on which the forecasts are based usually are contractor's programme not reflecting contractor's own delays 
			- EOT usually granted too late
			- Subsequent delays to progress of work due to contractor's own reasons, variations, and other external factors such as weather and Gov actions
			- Subsequent delays in materials delivery
			- Programme logic or sequence not realistic, or subsequent adjustments to sequence of works
			- Unplanned change in time of delivery of equipment or materials, such as lift, sanitary fittings, which attract big sums of payment
		- Cost
			- Cost estimates either not up-to-date to reflect adjustments to original contract sums, or tend to be conservatively high to keep reserves / secure budget
			- Provisional sums and contingency sums not suitably adjusted at appropriate time. Verbal instructions confirmed very late particularly when provisional sums and contingency sums are used up or taken out from budget
			- Payment generally tend to be too conservatively low
		- Forecasting method
			- Forecasting method too crude with little relevance to programme
			- Forecasting not done frequent enough to reflect changes
			- Forecasting method too detailed to take too much time to do each time and therefore cannot be done too frequently
			- Spreading of balance of conservatively high cost estimate over the rest of the contract period without due consideration of EOT or delay
	- Measures to improve
		- Time
			- Architects and Engineers to suggest realistic adjustments to contractor's programmes
			- Timing of delivery of major equipment or materials, such as lift, sanitary fittings, which attract big sums of payment to be more closely analysed and monitored
		- Cost
			- For cash flow purposes, funding can be transferred from one project to another so far as the total cash flow is kept reasonable to forecasts to avoid too much buffers allowed in individual project forecasts. Aggregating project together will create a cushioning effect on individual deviations from forecasts.
			- More volatile expenditures such as variations and provisional sums to be shown as a separate item in the forecasts to give an indication of degree of tolerance of the forecasts, and the buffers in the cost estimates for these expenditure should be reduced as soon as appropriate
		- Forecasting method
			- Cash flow forecasts to be done at more regular intervals using pragmatic methods, not too time consuming yet not too crude
- 4.3
	- Survey on re-entry
		- As soon as there is a real possibility of re-entry, QS should become vigilant in keeping an up-to-date record of the value of work done on site. This includes a thorough review of payment already made and to be made in respect of permanent works, temporary works, and MOS. Detailed records should also be kept in respect of the Contractor's plant and equipment.
		- Once a formal notice of re-entry is served, QS should invited the Contractor to attend a joint site survey, with a view to agreeing on the status and value of work done at the time of re-entry. Care should be taken to record the status of those items of work that are not fully completed. All defects should be noted. Any need for temporary protection work should also be recorded. If the Contractor fails to show up at the joint survey, QS should proceed with the survey and inform the Contractor or its liquidator of the results as soon as possible
	- Other immediate actions
		- Call in the bond by informing the bondsman, with relevant details, of the Contractor's failure to proceed with the Works and the Employer's decision to re-enter upon the Site
		- Set off any outstanding payment against 
		- Keep the Site safe with security guards
		- Protect, store and re-locate as necessary materials and uncompleted works
		- Extend existing or take out a new insurance policy
		- Liaise with relevant authorities to ensure continuity of temporary water and electricity supply
		- Keep record of additional expenditure in connection
	- Completing the Works
		- Consider alternative procurement strategies for completing the remaining works
		- Consider alternative of re-phasing the Works so as to give priority to completing essential items of work ahead of those non-essential items
		- Consider viability of employing the existing sub-con to complete the remaining works
		- Employ new contractor to complete the remaining works
		- Ensure mitigation of cost to the defaulting contractor
	- Calculating the Employer's claim against the Contractor
		- Expenditure
			- Money paid to the defaulting contractor
			- Expenditure after re-entry and before appointment of completion of contractor, such as costs in temporary protection and security upon re-entry, costs of insurances
			- Money paid to secure materials and suppliers
			- Money paid to the completion contractors to complete the remaining works including making good of defects in the re-entered works
			- Administration cost and consultancy fee
			- Damages arising from late completion of the project
		- Less
			- Hypothetical final account of the defaulting contract has it been completed successfully by the defaulting contract, including value of work completed under the completion contract and priced at the original rates of the defaulting contract
			- Those cost in the completion contract which cannot reasonably be regarded as within the scope of the defaulting contract
			- Payment received from Bondsman
			- Retention
			- Money withheld as security for the defaulting contract from the defaulting contractor under other contracts with the same Employer
- 4.4
	- Damage to the building
		- Assume within DLP, as default 12 months
		- C to be liable if the damages is proven to be caused by defects
		- C should have been informed prior to the end of DLP
		- Investigation should be done to prove
	- Damage to tenant's properties
		- Some difficulties in identifying whether these are eligible as part of direct loss or damage under the terms of the construction contract
	- Pros and cons to engage the other contractor
		- Delay in making good damage will cause dissatisfaction of tenants and attract adverse publicity
		- Making good of damage will remove the evidence
		- Lack of actions by the original C gives stronger ground for the company to employ others
		- Price quoted by the other contractor without tendering may be challenged by the original C
	- Necessary actions
		- Give final warning to the original Contractor
		- Liaise with the tenants to give words of comfort
		- Invite the original Contractor to carry out joint inspection and records before, during and after the making good, even though he is denying responsibility
		- Invite tenders if, or as much as, possible
		- Ask the new contractor to keep proper records
		- Hold the retention money and balance of the final account until the matter is settled
- 4.5
	- Causes
		- Human nature of greediness
		- Unrealistically low contract prices
		- Too many levels of sub-contracting
		- Contractors taking too much risks in design, soil conditions, etc.
		- Tight programme with high rate of LD
		- Consultant's incompetence
		- Reluctance or lack of promptness in granting EOT
	- Pre-contract measures
		- Less risks upon contractors
		- Measurement and valuation method taking into account varying site and soil conditions
		- More reasonable programme, more affordable rate of LD
		- Pre-qualify better tenderers

QUESTION 1 CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT (total 20 marks)

You are working for a Consultant Quantity Surveying Firm, QS Ltd. You just took over a project from a colleague who has now left your firm. The colleague has sent a draft tender document to the Client “Kindian Development Company Ltd.” for “the Main Contract for the Multi-functional Complex Development at NKIL 999Z, Mongkok, Kowloon”. There will be a number of Nominated Sub-Contracts and Supply Contracts. The draft has specified the following particulars to be inserted in the Appendix to the “Agreement & Schedule of Conditions of Building Contract for use in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” drawn up by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects, The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Hong Kong Branch) and The Society of Builders, Hong Kong, First RICS (HK Branch) Edition 1986 (with quantities) incorporating up to Second amendments published in July, 1999:

Write down a reminder for yourself in respect of item 1.1 below and draft a reply to the Client who has raised the queries in items 1.2 to 1.8 below on the draft Appendix and Conditions of Contract:

- **1.1 Appendix to Conditions of Contract** (2 marks)
	Suggest how the wordings entered in the right hand column can be improved to reduce ambiguities.

- **1.2 Defects Liability Period** (2 marks)
	Why has “12 months” been specified instead of “6 months” as stated on the Standard Form? State 2 items of work which may require liability for defects beyond the 12-month defects liability period and suggest a contractual arrangement to accommodate this.

- **1.3 Liquidated and Ascertained Damages** (2 marks)
	It is understood that liquidated and ascertained damages should be “a genuine pre-estimate of loss”. What constitutes the losses to be included in the estimate of liquidated and ascertained damages?

- **1.4 Period for Honouring Certificates** (2 marks)
	If the Employer is late in honouring a payment certificate, can the Main Contractor claim interest in this connection?

- **1.5 Surety Bond** (3 marks)
	Can the Employer call the Surety bond if a Nominated Sub-Contractor goes into liquidation? Give 3 additional measures that can be taken to safeguard the interest of the Employer from default by the Nominated Sub-Contractors?

- **1.6 Notice for Extension of Time** (3 marks)
	It is common to include a Special Condition of Contract requiring the contractors to submit notices of delay within a specified time as a condition precedent to consideration of their claim for extension of time. What is the purpose of the inclusion of such a term? What would be the practical difficulties encountered when implementing such a term from the respective point of view of both contract parties?

- **1.7 Neutral events** (2 marks)
	It is understood that the extension of time clause is for the protection of the Employer. The Employer wishes to delete as many neutral events as possible from Clause 23 of the Conditions of Contract. What would be the implications?

- **1.8 Lack of explicit terms** (4 marks)
	It seems that the Conditions of Contract do not have explicit provisions for granting extension of time for the following events:
	
	(a) Late possession of the Site;  
	(b) Late issue of consent by the Building Authority to the commencement of construction of work designed by the Architect;  
	(c) Late completion of work within the Site by the Electricity Supply Company.
	
	How would you comment on the above statement and do you consider that there are legitimate grounds to grant extension of time?

## Assessor Notes

- 1.1
	- DLP: 12 months after the substantial completion of the Works
	- Date for Possession: 7 calendar days from the Architect's written notice to commence
	- Date for Completion: 14 calendar days commencing from the Date of Possession
	- Period for Honouring Certificate: 14 calendar days from presentation
	- Period of Final Account: 12 months after the substantial completion of the Works
	- Amount of Surety Bond: 10% of Contract Sum to the nearest thousand dollars 
- 1.2
	- A 6-months period is inadequate to expose the test the completed works to the adversities of the four seasons. A 12-month period would cover the four seasons.
	- 12 month eriod has become the norm now except for minor and fitting out works. 
	- A 6-month period would be too short if the property is for sales purposes to allow for take-up by future owners and inspections by them
	- Some property sales and purchase agreement stipulate 12-month DLP
	- A guarantee or warrnaty given in favour of the Employer or future owner for a longer period would be the usual solution for waterproofing, external spray paint, curtain wall, window, chiller
- 1.3
	- Costs of financing the projecct for longer time
	- Costs of providing supervision and management by the Employer and his consultants for longer time
	- Costs of accelerating the subsequent contracts of the same project to catch up the time lost
	- Loss of business earning with due deductions for costs generating such earnings:
		- Loss of rental
		- Loss of interest over capital sales of the completed projects
		- Loss of recurring sales through use of the completed project
	- Additional costs of alternative accomodation pending completion of the delayed project
	- For government or public sectors projects, the intangible loss or social cost which may be assessed from a cost-benefit analysis
- 1.4
	- In the absence of express contract provisions, a payee is not entitled to interests on late payment under common law unless he receives a court judgement in his favour
	- Cl.32.13 for late payment
- 1.5
	- MC's surety bond is to guarantee the due performance of the Main Contract. Liquidation of NSC cannot be regarded as an act of non-performance by MC, therefore, the Employer cannot call the bond
	- According to the effect of the decision of a well known case "North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board v TA Bickerton & Son Ltd (1970) (the Bickerton case)", the MC is not vicariously liable for the direct financial consequences of the failure of a NSC. In fact, the extra cost of re-nomination should be borne by Employer
	- Even if MC is vicariously liable, like for DSC, there is still no reasonable ground for calling the bond if the MC continues the performance in place of the sub-contractor
	- Additional measures
		- Avoid nomination and instead use DSC - the use of performance specification of inclusion of selected / approved list of specialist firms to be DSC would allow the Employer's preferred firms to be considered in the DSC selection
		- Careful selection of NSC by pre-qualification exercies or short-listing of reputable firms for tendering
		- Demand NSC to provide a collateral warranty in favour of the Employer
		- Demand NSC to obtain a performance bond in favour of the Employer
		- Better payment terms, smaller retention, partnering, from the point of view of provising better working conditiosn for NSC
		- Bigger retention money, tighter and closer supervision, form the other point of view
- 1.6
	- The good intention of a notice provision could include:
		- To enable an early warning the delay be known ot the Architect os that the Architect can take early actions to mitigate the effect of the delay e.g. by discontinuing the cause of delay within his control of adopting alternatives to reduce the effects of the delay, before it is too late
		- To preserve the Employer's right to LD which may be lost if, due to Architect's unawareness of the implication of the delaying event, the Architect fails to consider and grant EOT at the appropriate time during the course of the Works
		- To force the Contractor to keep good records and documentation to support his EOT so that assessment of the claim by Architect can be easier
	- Such a term may also have the following intended uses which some people may not regard them as of good intentions:
		- To make it difficult for the Contractor to claim for EOT by creating administrative burden
		- To relieve the Architect's duty to pro-activiely deal with EOT unless and until the Contractor has given notice of delay
		- To bar later notice
	- Practical difficulties
		- A time bar element is usually included in the notice provision and it is this element which causes major difficulties between the contract parities
		- Difficulties from point of view of Employer & Architect:
			- Too much invalid notices and administrative burden
			- In order to preserve their rights, Contractors are submitting notices of delay for every possible or impossible cases. Mountains of paper are built-up just to serve the requirements for notice while the contents may be largely worthless causing both the Architect and the Contractor unnecessary time in doing the paper chase rather than dealing with the real issue
			- If the Contractor fails to comply with the notice provisions, the Architect would be losing his right to grant EOT even if he wishes to grant
			- Some Contractors are very poor in documentation and they never submit notices promptly. They will only submit claims fro EOT towards the end of the completion of the Works. Yet, the Architect may like to grant EOT for legitimate events to relieve the Contractor from buden of LD. However, because of the restrictive wordings of the notice provision, the Architect has lost his sole right to grant OET
			- A notice provision with time-bar element may not be upheld by the Court to relieve the Employer from his wrongdoing, even though the Contractor has failed to comply with the notice provision
		- Difficulties from the point of view of Contractor
			- The wordings of the notice provision can somtimes be very restictive that even a diligent and competent contractor may not be able to comply in terms of procedure, timing and documentation
			- Too much administrative burden just for the sake of submitting a notice in time
			- Early warnings are not receiving serious attention
			- Some Architects tender to wait till the effect of the delaying events becomes an actual fact before they consider the OET. They would not consider EOT for an excusable delay caught up by Contractors. Early warnings are therefore either rejected right away or are left unattended until too late to achieve the good intention
			- There is no corresponding time limit for the Architect to respond
			- Some Architects are always demanding more substantiation
- 1.7
	- More risks are put onto Contractors
	- Contractors' interest in tendering may decrease
	- Tenderers may require longer contract period or alternatively may increase the tender sums to cover the risks
	- Contractors may have to compromise the standard and quality of the Works to catch up delays caused by these neutral events
	- Contractors may be forced to become more claim conscious in order to recover time / money list due to delay caused by these neutral events
	- Contractors may work more diligently
	- Loss of chance to use neutral events as grounds for EOT in disguise of other events which may cause embarrassment to the PM or Consultants
- 1.8
	- Not applicable to SFBC 2005

	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250331135055.png)

## Assessor Notes

- 2.1
	- The indemnity clause defines the liability, while the insurance clauses require insurance policies
	- The requirements for effecting and maintaining insurances are without prejudice to the MC's liability to indemnify the Employer
	- The scope of liability may not be fully covered by the insurances; on the other hand, the insurances cover certain risks not within the scope of liability
	- Even though there is an indemnity clause, the loss and liability occasioned by an accident may be so great that the Contractor cannot bear and an indemnity clause would become practically useless
	- There are risks which are not within the scope of the indemnity clause and which have to be borne by the Employer
	- The purpose of the insurance clauses is to require the Contractor to take out insurances to relieve the possible financial burden upon the Contractor and the Employer in case of accident
- 2.2
	- CAR Section I is for all risks subject to exceptions, example:
		- Theft
		- Vibration and weakening of support causing damage to the Works
		- Temporary works constructed in performance of the Contract
		- Constructional plant and machinery, equipment, tools and temporary buildings
		- Removal of debris
- 2.3
	- Purpose of limits
		- The levels of excesses can affect the premium to be charged
		- Specifying limits gives a common basis for pricing
		- Ensures that the levels of excesses are reasonable for the purpose
	- Low excess
		- Higher premium
		- Better protection to the insured, reduced financial exposure to the Contractor which in turn poses less risk to the Employer
		- With the insurance cover as the safety net, the Contractor may tend not to exercise his best caution
		- May encourage small insurance claims
	- High excess
		- Converse to the effect of low excess
		- Higher tender sum to cover the higher risks
- 2.4
	- The risks of the Works pass to the Employer after completion and handover, while the risks to third parties rest with the Contractor as long as the Contractor is carrying out work for whatever purposes
	- Therefore, with the passing over of the risks, the CAR has to cease upon completion and handover and the Employer should arrange for his own insurance covers, while TPI would need to continue until the end of DLP or until there is no further work to be carried out by Contractor
	- The 14-day period after completion is a grace period for the changeover, e.g.
		- For contracts where there will be an immediate subsequent contract to follow on, the grace period is to allow the succeeding contractor time to effect an insurance to provide coverage for the completed works, possession of which is now reverted back to the Employer
		- For MC where there will not be any subsequent follow-on contracts, to allow ample time for the Employer to effect his own Property Insurance
	- After taking over the completed Works, the Employer would also need to take out his own TPI to cover his own risks independent of the Contractor's insurance
- 2.5
	- A Cross Liability Clause is attached to TPI or Section II of CAR
	- It would state to the effect that where the Insured consists of more than one party, the insurance shall apply to each party as if a separate policy had been issued to each party and the insurance company waives all subrogation rights against any of the joint-insured.
	- Although a TPI or CAR is usually issued in the joint name of the Contractor, his sub-contractors, the Employer, etc., all the members of the joint-insured will be looked upon as one single party
	- A party cannot benefit from his own wrongdoing. Therefore, without the Cross Liability Clause, any personal injury or death or property loss or damage caused by any member of the joint-insured to another member of the joint-insured would not be covered under the Policy
	- The inclusion of a Cross Liability Clause resolves the above issues
	- The limit of indemnity would remain the same
- 2.6
	- Empowering clauses
		- Maintenance of ECI is a statutory obligation. CC obliges MC to comply with any Act or Ordinance of Government
		- CC requires MC to maintain ECI to cover the liability of the MC in respect of personal injuries or deaths arising out of or in the course of or caused by the carrying out of the Works
	- Resident Architect
		- Resident Architect is directly covered by ECI effected by his own employer
		- Resident Architect may claim against the Contractor and the Employer who should be covered by TPI
		- Resident Architect may also sue any person actually causing the accident
- 2.7
	- When an owner seeks finance by mortgaging the Insured Property to his moneylender, the owner becomes the Mortgagor and his lender the Mortgagee. The Mortgagee, in order to secure his interest in such mortgage arrangement, will require that payment by the Insurance Company pursuant to the Insurance Policy in respect of loss or damage to the Insured Property be paid to the Mortgagee instead of the Owner, notwithstanding that the Mortgagee is not a party to the construction contract. Such arrangement shall not, however, affect in any way the rights and obligations as between the Insurance Company and the Owner under the Insurance Policy, and there is usually an explicit term in such clause.
	- A mortgagee clause is endorsed to CAR
- 2.8
	- Wrong Contractor's name, address, period of insurance
	- Item 1, 3, 4, 5 of the sum insured
	- Limit of indemnity should be unlimited in aggregate amount
	- Excess clause item (3) is too high to be acceptable
- 2.9
	- Annual policy
		- Should be endorsed to cover this Contract
		- Should be endorsed to cover Employer as the Principal
		- Should be renewed upon expiry
	- Other comment
		- The insurance is issued by the insurance broker who may not have authority to do so 
		- Geographical area to be extended to cover possible working in the Mainland
		- Estimated total annual earnings to be increased to cover this contract

## Question

QUESTION 3 MAINTENANCE WORKS 

(total 30 marks)

You are a Senior Quantity Surveyor within the Estate Management Department of an educational organisation with a large portfolio of buildings all over Hong Kong. The organisation has appointed an external Management Consultant to help formulate measures to reduce the operating costs of the organisation. Draft a memo in response to the following queries raised by the Management Consultant:

- **3.1 Term Contracts** (3 marks)
	What is meant by “Term Contract”? What are the circumstances under which you would adopt Term Contracts in preference to the use of in-house labour and/or other contract arrangements?

- **3.2 Schedule of Rates** (3 marks)
	Illustrate by worked example to show how tenders for a Term Contract are priced based on a printed/pre-priced Schedule of Rates without quantities?

- **3.3 Pitfalls** (3 marks)
	What are the pitfalls of using a printed/pre-priced Schedule of Rates as the basis for tendering and pricing?

- **3.4 Tender evaluation** (3 marks)
	Illustrate by worked example to show how the priority of tender prices submitted pursuant to item 3.2 are evaluated by (a) percentage weightings, (b) approximate quantities, and (c) approximate values?

- **3.5 Disclosure of tender evaluation criteria** (3 marks)
	What are the pros and cons in disclosing in the tender documents the weightings/approximate quantities/approximate values to be used for tender evaluation?

- **3.6 Staffing requirements** (3 marks)
	The Estate Management Department staff cost is presently $4 million per year. Set out your estimate of the numbers and grades of staff in the department. Give 3 suggestions, whether by way of contractual arrangement or project management, to reduce the staff cost without reducing the level of remuneration to individual members of staff, the volume of routine maintenance work nor the quality of monitoring the work.
	
- **3.7 Major renovation** (12 marks)
	A stand-alone contract is to be placed for major renovations, costing over $10 million, to the external walls of a multi-storey staff quarters building instead of using the existing Term Contracts.
	
	Describe in the form of a memo to your staff the special characteristics of the following matters for this type of work when compared to a new works project and explain how you would deal with them in the tender documents:
	
	(a) Possession of Site;  
	(b) Existing hidden defects;  
	(c) Insurances;  
	(d) Inclement weather;  
	(e) Completion time and liquidated damages;  
	(f) Method of measurement and billing of items.

## Assessor Notes

- 3.1
	- Term Contract 
		- A contract where the actual items and quantities of work is not fully determined upon the award of the Contract but will be instructed by means of works order to the Contractor who would stand by for a fixed period of time (2 to 3 years) to carry out the work as instructed during this period
	- Application to maintenance works where
		- The items of work are recurring over time
		- The size of each batch of work is small
		- The exact scope, quantities, time of each batch of work cannot be identified or quantified at the time of tender
		- Each batch of work requires commencement at short notice
		- The work requires intensive user interface
		- Work normally is repair in nature requiring little element of new design
	- Compare with other procurement method
		- In-house labour would involve long term staffing costs which may not be flexible enough to adjust in line with fluctuations in workload
		- Lump sum contract for the same period would not be possible because of the indefinite nature of the maintenance work
		- Calling quotations for each batch of work would be time consuming and administratively ineffective
- 3.2
	- Example of pricing
		- Pricing in the form of percentage adjustments to SOR rates
		- ![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805105312.png)
- 3.3
	- Pitfall of pre-priced SOR as basis for tendering and pricing
		- SOR are out-of-date
			- SOR updated no more than 3-5 years
			- Rates are out-of-date
			- New work or materials might not be updated
			- Price levels of items within the same work section may not change uniformly with time
		- Qty are not certain at the time of tendering
			- If future required qty not given, percentage might be manipulated to make a balance rather than reflecting market price
			- Assigned qty and wrights to different trades may not match the future requirement
		- Contractor might avoid carrying out under-priced items 
- 3.4
	- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250521160555.png)
	- Approximate values can most easily be estimated with reference to past records with projection for the coming term
	- Percentage weightings would be converted from the approximate values
	- Approximate quantities would need to be converted to approximate values by pricing at SOR and the approximate values used instead for evaluation calculation
- 3.5
	- Pros
		- Providing a good common basis for tendering with less speculation by tenderers
		- Providing a better indication of the scope, proportions, nature, items and quantities of work to enable tenderers to price the tenders with better accuracy
		- Adjustment percentages would be more compatible with the quantities of work to be carried out
		- Providing a more realistic budget for future cost control purpose
		- Providing a basis for explaining variance in future need against the estimated quantities
		- Providing a basis for checking unreasonable loading of adjustment percentages which may prejudice against the Employer
	- Cons
		- Less flexible for the Employer to change when there is a restriction on the quantities
		- Providing a basis for future dispute if actual quantities vary substantially from the estimated quantities indicated in the tenders
- 3.6
	- Grades of staff for the Estate Management Department
		- Estate Manager
		- Assistant Estate Manager
		- Architect / Designer / Building Surveyor
		- Maintenance Surveyor
		- Building Services Engineer
		- Clerk of Works / Work Supervisor
		- Quantity Surveyor
		- Clerical staff
		- Messengers and drivers
	- Calculate monthly salaries to match the total cost
	- Way to reduce staff cost
		- Outsourcing
		- Transferring more design responsibility to Contractors
		- Lumping together small work items with manageable variations in actual qty for pricing as one bigger lump sum per parcel of work so as to reduce the time to measure and value
		- Lumping together routine and repetitive work with fairly predictable qty over time for pricing as a lump sum charge for a fixed term or charge per month or per year, similar to maintenance contract for lift
		- Lumping work items in close vicinity together to be carried out at the same time to reduce time to inspect and document
		- Using batching method to check the accuracy of random samples of Contractors' valuation taken from groups of works orders and applying discounting factors necessary to correct any over-valuation by Contractors so revealed from the samples to all valuations within the same group as a penalty to the Contractors for over-valuation and as a means of reducing workload
		- Computerizing or better office automation may be a suggestion but should be suggested in such a way that would not require spending a lot of money on these alternatives before staff cost can be reduced
- 3.7
	- Possession of site
		- The building would still be in use. There would not be possession of sire. Rather, the Contractor will be given access, working areas and working space
		- If the private SFBC is used, the relevant clause on possession should be amended
		- Might be phased access and handover of working areas and working space
	- Existing hidden defects
		- New project do not have the problem of hidden defects which are common in renovation projects. The extent of hidden defects may not be fully identifiable until the exposure of the hidden parts
		- The method of pricing for the making good work should be appropriate for the circumstances
		- Firm qty of making good work in the tender documents may turn out to be very inaccurate
		- Pro qty of the making good work would reduce the contractor's risk in pricing, but may encourage malpractice such as tendency to maximize work items with profitable rates, minimize work items with non-profitable rates, over-stating actual measurement, corruption, etc.
		- Tenderers may be required to estimate at their own risk the extent of the making good work and allow for the costs either as a lump sum or as part of the rates for principal items. This would reduce the Employer's exposure to cost overrun, but the Contractor would tend to do less during actual execution, or try to claim in case of serious under-estimating.
		- Preambles should be amended to address the rules for measurement of items for repair works such as the making good of hair line cracks, partial hacking of rendering or the patching and repairing of isolated areas with new paint finishes
	- Insurance
		- Since the building would still be in use. Existing insurance, if any, for the existing building would normally not cover the renovation works. Insurance matters for the existing buildings, the Works, occupiers and third parties should be properly addressed.
		- Preferably, the different insurances should be insured with the same insurer
		- To check whether the existing policy can be endorsed to cover the renovation works
		- Occupiers may take the opportunity to ask the Contractor to carry out minor work for themselves. Liability may become mixed
	- Inclement weather
		- Inclement weather would seriously affect the execution of the work on the external walls
		- Normal practice to delete EOT provision for inclement weather in new works contract would not be appropriate here. EOT should be granted
		- Rainfall lighter than 20 mm may also have similar adverse effects
	- Completion time and LD
		- Phased commencement and phased completion are very likely to be required, but may be very difficult to define in precise terms. Whether an overall completion date or a more detailed phasing should be specified would need careful consideration
		- On the other hand, exactness of the completion date for renovation works may not be as critical as for new works. LD would not be as high as for new works
	- Method of measurement and billing of items
		- SMM does not have detailed rules for repair work
		- Some repair work involves small qty and narrow widths, which warrant measurement units and rules different from similar items in large areas
		- Repair work may also entail ancillary items which can either be measured separately or deemed included in the rates
		- The preambles or the item descriptions should reflect the special method of measurement, size classification, rates coverage, etc.
		- Travelling time and number of call-out services may be significant as compared to the value of work done and items should be included separately for pricing

The proposed design includes 8 No. 100 x 50m two-storey godowns, plus a 20 x 20 m seven-storey office building, of which one floor is a canteen/recreation area, on a site of 100,000 m2 . One lift will be provided to the office building. GCL has asked you to prepare a preliminary indication of costs for its reference. GCL would be contented if the estimate is given on a cost per m2 basis. The costs of goods storage and material handling equipment are to be excluded. Please prepare the estimate and a covering letter.

- **4.3 Alternative schemes** (5 marks)
	GCL would also like to know the cost implication if the godowns are changed to either (a) 4 No . 100 x 100 m   two-storey godowns, or (b) 8 No. 67 x 50 m three storey godowns. Please write to advise.

- **4.4 Programme** (5 marks)
	GCL has decided to keep the original scheme and requested you to prepare a cash in-flow table based on the following programme:
	
	(a) Phase 1 (4 No. Godowns and the office building) – 3 months design commencing after award of contract + 10 months construction;  
	(b) Phase 2 (4 No. Godowns) - commencing 6 months after Phase 1 commencement, 1 month for design adjustments (based on feedback from end-users of the first 4 No. Godowns) + 10 months construction;  
	(c) Godown construction – 8 months each;  
	(d) Office building construction – 10 months;  
	(e) Final external works – 2 months after completion of godown construction;  
	(f) Possession of whole site upon Phase 1 construction.
	
	Before preparing the cash in-flow table, draft a simple bar chart programme to represent the above. The programme only needs to be good enough for the purpose of compiling the cash in-flow table.

- **4.5 Cash flow** (5 marks)
	Based on your estimate and your bar chart programme, prepare the cash in-flow table as requested by GCL and a covering letter. Set out the monthly income horizontally. Consideration should be given to the time lag between work done and receipt of payment.

- **4.6 Costs of preliminaries** (10 marks)
	You have told GCL that the costs of preliminaries which can be deemed to be included in your cost estimate prepared on a cost per m2 basis is equivalent to 10% of the total of the cost estimate. You have advised that this percentage is based on statistics on competitive tendering. GCL would like to have a more detailed build-up of the costs of preliminaries for each of the two phases of the Works so as to compare this with the competitive percentage and to assist in judging the resources which can be afforded while remaining competitive. Draft a reply.

- **4.7 Prolongation** (10 marks)
	GCL has won the contract and is proceeding with it. During the course of construction of the structure of the godowns for Phase 1, because the Employer wanted to incorporate some potential users’ feedback, design revisions were required and the construction of Phase 1 has been delayed by 2 months. Phase 2 has not been significantly affected. The contract is still in progress and although the actual costs of prolongation are not fully committed yet, the Employer would consider agreeing to the prolongation cost reimbursement based on a reasonable estimate. GCL has advised that it has used your estimated preliminaries costs in submitting its tender and therefore would like you to use the same data to calculate the prolongation costs. Draft a claim for prolongation costs.

## Question

QUESTION 1 SAVINGS IN TIME AND COSTS

(total 25 marks)

Sub-Questions 1.1 and 1.2 are related, while Sub-Question 1.3 is independent from them.

- **1.1 Project programme** (total 5 marks)
	A developer has just acquired a 20,000m2 piece of land from the existing landowners with planning permission for residential development only.
	
	The permissible site coverage is 95% and the permissible plot ratio is 8. The height restriction is 150m.
	
	The land sale has been concluded but there are existing occupied buildings, of not more than 10 storeys high, on the land. The Developer has to negotiate with and pay compensation to the occupiers to secure their evacuation from the land. It is expected that evacuation will be completed 12 months from now.
	
	The Chairman of the Developer would like to build high-rise residential towers with flat sizes in the range of 80m2 to 120m2.
	
	Write, as the Developer’s Project Manager, a memo to the Chairman enclosing a bar chart programme showing the time required for design and construction from now until completion of the buildings and the obtaining of occupation permits.
	
	While the fine details normally found in a contractor’s construction programme are not expected, the programme should be as comprehensive as possible in terms of scope.

- **1.2 Time factors in design and construction** (total 15 marks)
	It is now 9 months after you first prepared the Project Programme for Sub-Question 1.1. Evacuation of the existing occupiers has not been easy. Compensation agreements have just been signed with all the existing occupiers under which they have committed to leave the land 12 months from now. This is later than the original date envisaged in your first Project Programme.
	
	The Chairman has demanded that the original completion date in your first Project Programme should not be changed and has asked you to submit, for his consideration, a report setting out all the possible measures which may be used to shorten the programme so that the original completion date is maintained, subject to the following constraints:
	
	(a) The total floor areas cannot be reduced;  
	(b) The time for evacuation of the existing occupiers from the land would not be changed; and  
	(c) The permissible land use would not be modified.
	
	Respond, state limitations to each measure proposed and give a priority ranking of the measures proposed. You know that the Chairman is generally receptive to new ideas.

- **1.3 Cost factors in construction** (total 5 marks)
	In this very competitive bidding environment, contractors are tendering at cost or even below cost in order to survive.
	
	Either: Write, as a Contractor’s QS, a memo to your Project Director to suggest ways and means to reduce the tender prices, reduce the costs and enhance profits, without compromising the quality and safety of construction.
	
	Or: Write, as a Consultant QS, a letter to the Employer, after the award of the Contract, to suggest ways and means to help the Contractor, who has submitted an apparently very low tender, to complete the Contract without making unreasonable claims and without compromising the quality, safety and time of construction.

## Question

QUESTION 2 TENDERING

You act as the Consultant QS for Question 2.

- **2.1 Piling tenders with design submission** (total 10 marks)
	Write a letter to the Architect to advise on the following:
	
	(a) Apart from the Form of Tender and the Summary of Tender, what are the usual submissions required to be provided with a tender for the design and installation of foundation piles, differentiating between those which are contractually binding and those which are for reference only. Give reasons for requiring these submissions and for the differentiation;
	
	(b) Inconvenience to tender assessment if information submitted is not complete;
	
	(c) Possible reasons for tenderers being reluctant to submit all the information as requested;
	
	(d) Reasons for imposing a rule to disqualify tenderers who fail to provide all the submissions as requested, drawbacks if this rule is strictly followed, and pitfalls if this imposed rule is subsequently relaxed;
	
	(e) Pitfalls in inviting tenderers to submit outstanding information after the opening of tenders; and
	
	(f) Consolidated solutions to reduce the problems revealed in the above discussions, with reasonable balance between the interests of different parties involved.

- **2.2 Tender assessment** (total 10 marks)
	The Conditions of Tender for a building contract with Bills of Quantities state that tenderers shall fully complete, sign, witness and date the Form of Tender, shall fully price, extend, cast and total the BQ and shall not qualify the tenders, and that failing to do so may invalidate their tenders.
	
	After checking the tenders and interviewing the tenderers, you have found that the lowest tender, being 5% lower than the second lowest tender, contains the following irregularities:
	
	(a) The Registration No. And the date of expiry of the Tenderer’s Company Registration Certificate have not been stated on the Form of Tender as required;
	
	(b) The Tender Sum as stated in words in the Form of Tender, the Tender Sum as stated in figures in the Form of Tender and the priced total of the BQ do not tally with one another;
	
	(c) The quantity of a BQ item has been changed from 100m3 to 150m3 without prior authorization;
	
	(d) A Tender Addendum which required changes to the BQ has not been incorporated;
	
	(e) Only a total sum has been inserted on the collection page of the Plasterer Bill, with no rates and item/page totals inserted on any page of that Bill; and
	
	(f) The rate for the external wall tiling for the whole building is 70% lower than those of other tenders. At the tender interview, the lowest tenderer explained that it was because he considered that there would be a very high chance that the specified external wall tiling would be omitted at post-contract stage due to cessation of production and that it would be replaced by another type of finish. He also proposed at the meeting that the submitted rates would be applicable to another type of external wall finish if selected as the replacement. You find that this alternative is normally 70% cheaper than that specified in the BQ.
	
	Now, just prior to the completion of the final tender report, write a memo to your supervisor to inform him what you have done to handle each of the above cases, your recommendations to be put into the tender report, and the rationale behind all these.

- **2.3 Professional ethics** (total 5 marks)
	Write a memo to your assistants who are about to take part in analyzing tenders to describe:
	
	(a) Measures which should be implemented to uphold professional ethics; and (b) Acts which are likely to be perceived as corrupt practices.

## Assessor Notes

- 2.1
	- Core issues
		- Additional tender submissions on top of the completed Tender Documents are generally for appraisal of the tenders to ensure that the tenders are technically suitable and financially adequate, and tenders have a thorough understanding of the tender requirements. The submissions are usually for reference only
		- Tender assessment would be difficult or time consuming if information submitted is not complete
		- Tenderers are reluctant to submission all the information because of huge costs, limited time, business secretes, etc.
		- A strict rule may resolve the problems of incomplete submission, but may disinterest tenderers who care and disqualify tenderers who do not care ending up in substantial reduction in the number of eligible tenderers. Subsequent relaxation of the rule after tender return will encourage tenderers not to respect it in future tendering exercise
		- Tenderers may take the opportunity to introduce fresh information to their advantage when they are given a chance to submit further information after opening of tenders
		- Rules must be strictly followed, but only crucial information should be demanded to minimize tenderer's burden
	- Other usual submissions requires
		- Design
			- Preliminary piling plan - to judge appropriateness and sufficiency of piling design proposed
			- Preliminary pile caps, strap beams and tie beams layout plan with sizes - to judge whether pile caps design would be excessive to enable a cheap piling tender
			- Structural calculations - to counter-check the correctness of the piling and pile cap plan
		- Method statement - to understand the proposed method of working
		- Site safety supervision plan - to provide a reference for post contract development of the formal plan
		- Preliminary programme - to judge that due allowances have been made for design, approval, consent, construction, testing, acceptance
		- Site layout plan and phasing plan - to understand the proposed site set-up
		- List of plant and equipment - to judge the capability of tenderers to comply with the programme
		- Organisation chart and CV of key personnel - to judge the capability of the site management
		- Past experience, safety and other track records - to judge the past capability of tenderers
		- Current workload - to judge the current capability of tenderers
		- Financial information such as annual reports - to judge the financial capability of tenderers
	- Binding or reference only
		- Technical submissions are for reference only during tender assessment and not contractually binding; To allow flexibility to adjust for formal submission after award
		- Types of piles are usually contractually binding because this is the essence of the design proposal, and the information is usually specifically stated in the SOT or FTO
		- A tenderer may be required to agree before award that other design information or other tender submissions, which are supposed to be for reference only, are contractually binding in order to ensure that he would fulfill his commitment as indicated on those tender submission
	- Inconvenience to tender assessment if information submitted is not complete
		- Not possible to assess the tender in the absence of a tender clarification process
		- Tender clarification process may have pitfalls as discussed later
		- Longer time for the tender clarification process, if allowed
		- Longer time for the overall tender assessment process, thereby delaying the contract award
	- Possible reasons for incomplete submission
		- Costly to submit complete information as requested. Unless a tenderer is very confident that he has a very high chance of getting the contract, he may not be willing to spend money on preparing the submitting complete design information
		- Fear of competitive design ideas being borrowed and shared with other tenderers through the tender clarification process, thus losing the competitive edge
		- Financial status is a business secrete which should not be disclosed
		- Fear of exposure of unfavorable factual information 
		- Not enough tendering period to prepare all the required submission
		- Tactic of tenderers to test their positions in tenders
		- Tenderers are not really interested
	- Reasons for imposing a DQ rule for incomplete submission
		- To ensure complete submission at tender return
	- Drawbacks if this rule is strictly followed
		- May reduce the number of interested tenderers
		- May result in a lot of DQ if tenderers do not take the rule seriously, thereby affecting the success of the tender exercise
	- Pitfalls if this imposed rule is subsequently relaxed
		- This will be unfair to those tenderers who have submitted complete information at tender return
		- In extreme cases, unsuccessful tenderers who submitted a set of complete information may lodge complaint against an award of the contract to a tenderer who supplemented his submission through the tender clarification process
		- If incomplete submission is to be tolerated, similar rules in future tendering will not be seriously respected and complied with by tenderers, thus ending up with the same problem of incomplete submission
	- Pitfalls in inviting outstanding information after opening of tenders
		- Tenderers may try to manipulate their supplementary information to their advantage
		- Tenderers may introduce new qualifications when answering requests for outstanding information
		- The above will be unfair to those tenderers who have submitted complete information at tender return
		- Consultants would have to spend more time to deal with the above and may need to ask other tenderers again in the light of fresh information introduced by a tenderer to ensure fairness. A virtual re-tendering is in place which may be subject to query if very strict accountability is to be followed
	- Solution
		- Distinguish between those submission which are really crucial and those which are not, and demand only for those which are crucial
		- Adopt two-stage tendering: crucial information for assessment of tenders must be submitted at tender return, falling which the tenders will not be considered. Further, information that is costly to prepare to be submitted after tender return upon the request of the Employer. By doing so, only these tenderers who have a high chance to be awarded will need to submit such information which is costly to prepare.
		- Clients who are not one-off developer should set up a track record to earn the trust of tenderers that tenderers' ideas, financial status, business secrets would not be disclosed to others and tender conditions will be consistently and fairly applied. However, this track record could only be established over time
		- Ask tenderers to submit some of the information during the pre-qualification process
		- Ensure that tenderers invited are really interested by giving them more advance information prior to formal tendering and by conducting a more thorough pre-qualification process
		- Allow a reasonable tendering period
- 2.2 
	- Missing Registration No. And date of expiry of Tenderer's Company Registration Certificate should not amount to DQ of tender but should be requested for
	- The express provisions of the Tender Documents should be checked for rules to deal with the discrepancy in Tender Sum. In the absence of express provisions, the FOT should take precedence over the priced BQ, but the priced BQ and other parts of the tender submission could be used to ascertain which amount stated in FOT was truly intended by the Tenderer. Confirmation should be made with the Tenderer before contract award.
	- The quantity in BQ should not be changed without prior authorization. Generally, the Tenderer should be asked to confirm to abide by original BQ quantities. QS check if original qty wrong.
	- Generally, Tenderer should be asked to confirm that the tender is deemed to include the Tender Addendum. Check whether tenderer has received TA and returned acknowledgement of receipt.
	- The Tenderer should be asked to submit the missing priced pages for the Plaster Bill, and careful check should be done to ensure that the rates are appropriate and the priced total matches the total sum on the collection page. Otherwise, the Tenderer should be asked to re-adjust and should even be disqualified in case of serious malpractice.
	- Qualification of tender introduced during the tender interview should not be entertained. The Tenderer should be required to confirm that the tender rate would be applicable to the specified type of tile. Any post contract change to another type of tile should have due regard to the difference in supply costs of the two types of tiles.
- 2.3
	- Core objectives
		- Prevent leakage of confidential information
		- Maintain fairness to all
		- Avoid conflict of interests
		- Do not take bribes or benefits or offer benefits in exchange for past or future gain
	- Possible examples of ways to achieve the core objectives
		- Inform the Client if a tenderer, participating through an open invitation to tender, is also one of your clients on another project
		- Make all tenders confidential. Keep and store the tenders and your analysis in safe places
		- Ensure that staff members participating in the tender analysis process do not have private business or family or other beneficial relationship with tenderers
		- Restrict other staff members not participating in the tender analysis process from getting assess to the tender inform
		- Issue to all tenderers with tender clarification queries which arise with a tenderer and are likely to affect other tenderers
		- Record all communications with tenderers
		- Avoid accepting entertainment from tenderers
		- Sign confidential agreement

#ContractAdmin  #Payment #EOT 
## Question

QUESTION 3 POST CONTRACT
*(Total 25 marks)*

- **3.1 Contract Documents** _(Total 5 marks)_
	In the second month of the construction of a project, the Contractor applies for 30% of the Contract Sum as the first payment based on a special term inserted by the Contractor in the Form of Tender during tendering, while the draft payment valuation issued by the Contract Administrator amounts to only 5% of the Contract Sum, based on normal valuation of progress. It is found that the Form of Tender is not physically bound into the Contract Documents, which have already been bound and signed.
	
	Acting as an independent expert QS, write a letter to the Employer to advise what should be investigated to find the facts of the case and whether the special payment terms should be entertained based on the possible findings.

- **3.2 Payment for Materials** _(Total 5 marks)_
	The Schedule of Rates for a contract has included a rate of $120/m for 200mm underground drain pipes. The Contractor has applied for payment for materials on site at $105/m, supported by a supplier’s invoice and delivery notes showing $105/m. The Contract Administrator has only valued the payment amount for materials on site at $55/m.
	
	Acting as an independent expert QS, write a letter to the Employer to advise on:
	
	(a) The respective grounds of the Contractor and the Contract Administrator;  
	(b) Your opinion as to the correct interpretation; and  
	(c) Your recommended solution to balance the interests of the Employer and the Contractor.

- **3.3 Extension of Time** _(Total 15 marks)_
	The particulars of a contract are as follows:
	
	1. Contract scope: Major A&A works to an existing rehabilitation centre located on five floors of a multi-storey multi-purpose complex.
	2. Original Contract Sum: $30 Million.
	3. Original Contract Period: 12 months.
	4. Contract Commencement Date: 12/3/2002.
	5. Contract Date for Completion: 11/3/2003.
	6. Liquidated and Ascertained Damages (LADs): $15,000 per day.
	
	You may assume the use of any one of the current Private or Government Standard Forms of Contract for Building or Civil Engineering Construction for this sub-question, and you shall specify the Form chosen in your answers.
	
	By February 2003, the Contractor had been in serious delay with no entitlement to an extension of time. According to the Contractor’s revised programme submitted on 15/2/2003, his anticipated date for completion of the Contract was mid-May 2003, i.e., a two-month delay was anticipated. The Architect had endorsed such a revised programme after he had examined it.
	
	On 22/3/2003, there were suspected cases of SARS amongst other occupants of another organisation on another floor within the multi-purpose complex, and the complex was subject to tight ingress/egress control by the Health Authorities, awaiting medical diagnosis of the patients. The patients’ illnesses were later confirmed to be non-SARS related, and the control was lifted on 2/5/2003, but no construction work was possible during the controlled period. The value of work completed upon suspension of work was 65% of the Original Contract Sum.
	
	The Operator of the Centre, after reviewing the situation, instructed the Contractor via the Architect to continue suspension of the Works until further notice.
	
	Questions:
	
	(a) The date now is 18/6/2003. As the Contractor’s QS, submit to your Project Director:
	
	(i) A programme depicting the various events described above; and (ii) A full appraisal of the contractual and financial positions of the Employer and the Contractor, with suggestions on possible viable options to the Contractor in such circumstance to assist your Project Director to decide on his future course of action.
	
	(b) With assurances from the Employer that the case would be dealt with fairly and reasonably according to the Contract, the Contractor resumed work on 28/6/2003 upon instruction and practically completed the Works on 18/9/2003.
	
	The date now is 20/9/2003. As the Consultant QS on the Project, write to advise the Employer on the Contractor’s entitlement to extension of time, and liability for liquidated damages, with references to the relevant provisions/conditions of the Contract.

## Assessor Notes

- 3.1
	- Core issues
		- A document not physically bound into the Contract Documents may still be considered as a contractually binding part of the Contract if valid reference is made to it by those forming part of the Contract Documents
		- Investigations should be carried out to see whether the special payment term or the FOT has been specifically excluded one way or other to the effect of voiding any interpretation that the special payment term is still valid
		- Depending on the possible findings, different conclusions can be drawn
	- Additional points
		- While it is not welcome by Consultants that a special term be inserted by tenderers in FOT, such insertion cannot be ignored or deemed to be void since the FOT, representing the offer, is the most significant part of the returned tender. In the absence of express rejection of such a special term in the subsequent chain of tender correspondence up to LOA, it should, after award of the Contract, be deemed to have been accepted
		- On the other hand, a document not physically bound into the Contract Documents is usually treated as not forming part of the Contract. However, if it is referred to by those forming part of the Contract, it may be regarded as having contractual effect by reference, for example, a reference to the British Standard
		- In the present case, the onus should be on the Contractor to prove that such reference exists and the physical absence of EOT from Contract Documents was a common mistake which should be rectified
		- Investigation must therefore be made to see why the EOT was not included
		- The possible investigations and implications include:
			- Check Contract Documents to see whether FOT has been specifically excluded or superseded in its entirety from forming part of the Contract - the special payment term is void if FOT has been specifically excluded
			- Check Contract Documents to see whether the special payment term has been specifically rejected or impliedly superseded by another subsequent set of payment terms - the special payment term is void if a subsequent set of payment terms has been agreed
			- Check the Contract Documents to see whether there is any specific reference (e.g. listed in LOA) or implied link to the FOT and whether such reference or link is unbroken until the contract signing - if an unbroken chain of reference or link exists, then it is highly likely that there was no consensus between the contract parties, except by the act of signing the contract, that the special payment term is no longer valid
			- Check files and people who were involved in the tender negotiation, tender award and contract documentation to recall reasons for non-inclusion of FOT - if there is a clear evidence that the non-inclusion of the FOT was intentional to the knowledge of the Contractor, then the special payment term cannot be entertained
			- Check whether there are collateral agreements in connection with the special payment term
- 3.2
	- Core issues
		- The Contractor would insist that the payment for materials on site should be based on his cost of supply the materials to site, otherwise his cash flow would be seriously jeopardized
		- The Contract Administrator would argue that the residue value of the all-in rate after paying the material costs as demanded would not be sufficient to complete the work, and therefore, sufficient amount should be retained for the installation cost
		- Payment for materials should in principle be sufficient to compensate the Contractor the costs of supplying the materials to site. However, if the balance of the all-in rate after paying the material cost is significantly insufficient to cover the cost to fix the materials and finish with the work, then only a reasonable proportion of the all-in rate can be paid for materials
	- Additional points
		- Contractor's view
			- The Contract specifies that value of materials delivered to site shall be payable in progress payment. The value should mean the costs of supplying the materials to site
			- The cost of supplying the materials to site have been proven by invoice amount
			- Costs of materials, if not fully paid, will affect the Contractor's cash flow
			- Materials should be paid in full in order to secure the Employer's title to the materials
			- The Contractor is very efficient in the installation of the drain pipe and $15/m is sufficient for drain pipe installation
			- If the "reasonable proportion" principle or the "sufficient residual installation value" principle  is adopted by the Contract Administrator, then the same principle should be applied to all other items. This may mean that the value of materials payable could be more than the material costs for those items which have been adequately priced
		- Contract Administrator's view
			- The maximum costs of materials payable should be subject to the price allowed for in the all-in rates. Therefore, the value of materials on site should be derived from a reasonable breakdown of the all-in rates
			- The balance after paying the material costs should be sufficient for the Contractor to finish work otherwise it would impose loss on the Employer if the Contractor goes bankrupt. The balance of $15/m is inadequate
		- Correct interpretation
			- The correct interpretation should refer to the contract provision on the payment for materials on site
			- SFBC uses the words "estimated value of the materials and goods". In the normal sense, the term "value" could mean that the costs to Contractor. There should be no problem if the all-in rates have been reasonably priced. This probably is the original intention of the standard form. However, the contract draftsman could have used the word "costs" if they intended so. This probably demonstrates that the term "value" is not always equal to "costs" but must be subject to other considerations
			- Gov GCC use the words "estimated contract value". This probably was intended to reinforce the interpretation that the all-in rates should have a bearing
			- There is validity in both the arguments of the Contractor and the Contract Administrator and this may not be easily solved without a legal debate
		- Recommended solution
			- Check the valuation for other materials on site items within the same payment valuation to see the implication if one principle or the other is consistently applied to them as well. It may be possible that when different principles are consistently applied to all items, there would not be much significant difference between the end results
			- Do similar check taking the Contract as a whole to see if there is any balancing effect if one principle or the other is consistently applied
			- A principle which could be consistently applied should have a greater convincing power. Hopefully, a compromised solution can be worked out
			- A balance is required to be maintained to facilitate the cash flow of the Contractor and to safeguard the Employer's interests in case the Contractor cannot perform
			- The possibility of the Contractor not performing should be assessed. If this possibility is remote, then payment can be relaxed. If the possibility is imminent, the Employer can only take a more cautious stance.

	- Position as at 18/6/2003
		- Before the outbreak of SARS, the Contractor had been in culpable delay with liability for LAD estimated to be around $0.92M for two months' delay
		- Two further delays, both not due to the Contractor's fault, arose during the period of culpable delay
		- The 42-day suspension due to ingress / egress control was due to a neutral event which could be considered as:
			- An event of force majeure with EOT under cl.25.1(3)(a) of SFBC but without financial compensation
			- An event to comply with statutory requirements which is a risk of the Contractor; or
			- An event of special circumstances with EOT under SFBC
		- The further period of suspension as ordered by Employer through Architect would safely be considered as:
			- A postponement instructed under cl.25.1(3)(j) of SFBC with EOT and financial compensation under cl.25.1(2)(e)
		- It would be reasonable to adopt a dot-on approach to excusable delay within a period of culpable delay (Case Balfour Beatty v Chestermont)
		- No work could be done during the period of suspension, therefore, the Contractor could not take the opportunity to catch up his earlier culpable delay. Suspension without EOT or without financial compensation would aggravate the financial burden. The Contractor would find ways to escape from Contract
		- The Contract may allow the Contractor to:
			- Determine his employment after serving of notice after 120 days suspension under cl.36.1 of SFBC
			- Determination cannot waive the liability for LD up to date of determination
			- On the strength of the stronger contractual position, take the good chance to re-negotiate with the Employer better terms for the time, cost and liability to complete the Works after the suspension is over
	- Position as at 20/9/2003
		- With the resumption of the Works, the Contractor's right to determination. The Contractor's rights for EOT and L&E during suspension is until resumption plus additional time to be allowed for re-mobilization, extra work for re-joining or re-connection to work suspended, and inefficiency in the early stage of resumption
		- It can be implied from the words "with assurances from the Employer that the case would be dealt with fairly and reasonably" that the Contractor must have taken certain course of action resulting in the Employer giving such assurances, e.g. Contractor agreeing to resume work without choosing to determine the employment. The liability for LD must therefore be considered with this in mind, i.e. what would have happened if the Contractor did choose to determine. Waiver to a certain extent should be considered if the Contractor is to be fairly treated as assured.

## Question

QUESTION 4 FINAL ACCOUNTS

(total 25 marks)

A contract for the construction of a residential building with 30 storeys of typical floors plus G/F and Roof (excluding foundations but including all building services as domestic subcontract work), tendered based on Drawings and Specification without Bills of Quantities, contains the following price breakdown:
  
<html><body><table><tr><td>Description</td><td>Amount ($)</td></tr><tr><td>Preliminaries</td><td>7,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Measured Works for Typical Floors from 1/F to 30/F</td><td>40,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Measured Worksfor G/F and Roof</td><td>5,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Provisional Sums</td><td>5,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Contingencies</td><td>2,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total Contract Sum:</td><td>59,000,000</td></tr></table></body></html>

The price breakdown for the Measured Works for Typical Floors from 1/F to 30/F contains, amongst others, the following items:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250401100540.png)

As evidenced by the sole supplier’s quotations submitted after the award of the Contract, the supply rate for “ABC” ceramic tiling is $50.00/m², and the supply rate for “XYZ” artificial granite slab is $800.00/m².

It is also found after the award of the Contract that the correct quantity of item 7/C is 50m².

The Architect’s fee is very low, matching a very limited scope of service. No Consultant QS has been appointed. The final account is basically being settled by the Employer himself with the Contractor. Disagreements have arisen between the Employer and the Contractor.

You act as an independent QS expert to advise a dispute resolution committee set up between the top management of the Employer and the Contractor on Sub-Questions 4.1 to 4.3 below. In each case:

1. Describe the possible arguments from each of the contracting parties.
2. State your opinion as to the correct view.
3. Suggest a solution to the problem, striking a proper balance between the interests of the contracting parties when neither of them is absolutely right.
4. Describe measures which should have been taken to avoid such problems.

- **4.1 Valuation of Variations** **(Total: 15 marks)**
	Address disagreements over the valuation of any 4 out of the following 6 variations:
	
	(a) Omit the topmost typical floor, instructed when the construction of the R.C. structure reached 25/F.
	
	(b) Change the pattern of the teak parquet flooring from basket pattern to herringbone pattern, instructed when the teak parquet flooring was already delivered to a store on G/F.
	
	(c) Add 100m² of the original artificial granite slab paving, but with an overall thickness of 100mm, including screeding.
	
	(d) Increase the area of item 7/D above by 100m².
	
	(e) Change “XYZ” artificial granite slab to 15mm “PQR” artificial granite tile at a supply rate of $200/m².
	
	(f) Omit the work represented by item 7/C above entirely.

- **4.2 Indirect Costs in Unit Rates** **(Total: 5 marks)**
	Address the disagreement over a claim submitted by the Contractor that when building up star rates for variation additions, in addition to the normal markup of 15% for profit and overhead, extra allowances should also be made for insurance premiums. These premiums have not specifically been priced against the relevant preliminaries items but have been allowed for in the rates for the measured works. The insurance premiums initially paid, based on the original contract sum, are $2,400,000.

- **4.3 Mark-up for overheads and profit** (total 5 marks)
	Address a disagreement over a star rate build-up submitted by the Contractor for the addition of 200 No. Metal lockers (with no similar items in the Contract) as follows:

## Assessor Notes

- 4.1
	- Omitting the top most floor
		- Disagreement could arise over whether the cost omission calculated by E would be too simplified without taking into account the elements of costs which could not be omitted in direct proportion to the reduced number of storey at this stage of construction
		- The omission should not simply be calculated as 1/30 of typical floors. 
			- The effect of small qty per floor on the top most typical floors should be accounted for, e.g. structural qty. The effect of some fixed qty which do not change in direct proportion to the number of floors should be accounted for, e.g. main plant and equipment and vertical main services cannot be proportionally omitted.
			- The effect of reduced number of repetitive use of formwork or other similar temporary work should be accounted for
			- The effect that sub-contract labour only or work prices could not be reduced sensitively in relation to the omission should be accounted for
		- Direct loss and expense over normal measure and value valuation should be recognized by E and should be mitigated and substantiated by C
			- Materials ordered for the top most floor could have become abortive. The relative significance of premature delivery of materials and the commitment to purchase the materials should be evaluated. Materials prematurely delivered will not be entitled to IP but should still eventually be payable if the commitment to purchase under the supply contract cannot be cancelled.
			- Actual loss of recovery of overheads and profits should be accounted for. In this connection, the reduction of the preliminaries and overhead due to the shorter construction period, and the contribution to overheads and profits from other additions to the Contract Sum should also be considered
			- C is obliged to mitigate the loss by re-selling and re-deploying any surplus materials, re-negotiating with the suppliers and subcon to reduce their cancellation charges, damages, loss and expense, etc., re-deploying labour, plant and overheads, etc.
			- C is obliged to substantiate his loss and expense
			- E's demand for substantiation should not be unduly onerous
		- Direct loss and expense could have been reduced if the decision to omit the floor could be made earlier
	- Changing teak parquet flooring pattern
		- Disagreement could arise over whether the differences in wastage and laying costs between the two laying patterns have been accounted for
		- The same materials can be used to lay to the two different patterns, but the herringbone pattern would be more difficult to lay and would require more cutting wastage
	- Contradictory rates for valuing additional qty of original artificial granite slab paving
		- The contract rate for granite slab and screed over 50mm thick is higher than that for overall 150mm thick. E would pro-rata downward from the cheaper 150mm while C would pro-rata upward from the more expensive 50mm item
		- A star rate could be negotiated from the known supply rate of $800/m2. In case of deadlock, the average of 50m item and 150mm item would possibly be the only solution because this is strictly a pro-rata rate from contract rates
		- The problem could have been avoided if the inconsistency was dealt with at the tender assessment stage by agreeing more consistent rates for variation purposes
	- Under-priced rates for valuing additional qty
		- Item 7/D is found to be under-priced. C would ask for deviation from this contract rate for the additional qty while E would maintain this to be binding.
		- C might argue that the increase is substantial thus rendering the contract rate inapplicable
		- C might argue that he has already suffered loss. He should not be caused to suffer additional loss by reason of increase of qty of under-priced item
		- E's view is more correct. Upward adjustment of under-priced rate could only be a compassionate measure when the loss is substantial.
		- The problem could have been avoided if the under-priced rates were dealt with at the tender assessment stage by agreeing more reasonable rates for variation purposes
	- Changing artificial granite slab to artificial granite tile
		- Disagreement could arise over whether the rate for the granite tile should be calculated pro-rata downward from the more expensive granite slabs or pro-rata upward from the cheaper ceramic tiles, or assessed as a star rate
		- The ceramic tiles would appear to be the more suitable base for pro-rata in view of their comparable supply prices, sizes and thickness
		- A star rate assessment may be done as a counter-check and a compromise worked out
	- Omitting the work represented by item 7/C entirely
		- Disagreement could arise over whether the quantity to be omitted should be based on 100m2 as explicitly priced or based on the correct qty of 50m2
		- Since qty do not form part of the contract which is based on dwg and spec without qty, the omission should be based on the correct qty as shown on dwg or inferred from spec
		- The problem could have been avoided if BQ or careful check
	- Additional point
		- Validity of variation
- 4.2
	- Disagreement could arise over whether the allowance for insurance premium should be deemed to have been included in the prelim prices and whether corresponding adjustments could be made due to variation additions
	- E would argue for no further adjustments 
		- It is the C's own choice and risk to allow for the insurance costs in the prelim or measured works
		- Insurance costs have been allowed for discreetly in other specifically priced prelim items
		- The normal norm of 15% mark-up should be adequate to cover any additional insurance costs occasioned by the variation additions
	- C would argue that 
		- He could demonstrates that the allowance for insurance costs was in fact included in the measured works and the same principle should be adopted for valuing rates for variation additions
		- C has the freedom to include the cost of insurance in any rates and prices in the Contract
		- The cost of insurance will increase in direct proportion to the value of work carried out in the project, it is therefore logical to include the cost of insurance in the rates for measured works
	- C's argument would probably be more correct but would need a lot of substantiation to prove
	- While contracts usually stipulate that prelim prices are not to be adjusted for variations, they do allow for direct loss and expense adjustment in case application of the contract rates to variations has become unfair
	- Contractors are usually allowed the freedom to price for prelim items either in the prelim section or in the measured works section
	- The usual rules of precedence for valuing variations are contract rate, pro-rata rate, and fair rate. This implies that the method and level of pricing the contract rates should be maintained for variation rates so far as reasonable. Therefore, if C could demonstrate that the insurance costs have actually been allowed for in the unit rates for measured works, then the same method should be used for calculating fair rate
	- Comparison with other tender prices and comparison of prices and costs may help the assessment of the reasonableness of the C's claim
	- Investigation must be done to see whether
		- The prelim prices have already been high enough that some allowances for insurance costs must have been discreetly included
		- A more suitable mark-up instead of the normal norm of 15% should be used to reflect the variable overheads and profits
	- C would have a difficult task to substantiate to E's complete satisfaction if E is taking a very onerous stance. A comparison with the prelim prices quoted by other tenderers for the Contract, a comparison with the general market ratio of prelim prices to the measured works, a comparison of the actual insurance costs with the total prelim price, etc may help from a reasonable indication without resource to onerous substantiation
	- To avoid problems of similar nature, it could be specifically stated in the Prelim to the effect that the insurance costs should only be included in the Prelim and no claim for loss and expense will be entertained if the tenderer chooses to price for the costs in the measured works section
- 4.3
	- The 15% mark-up for profit and overhead is usually regarded as an industry norm without contest. However, C would usually treat this as a mark-up over every tier of sub-contracting. This would end up in this case with 32.25% mark-up on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant
	- The norm of 15% mark-up should in fact be a mark-up on direct costs of labour, materials and plant, not on sub-contract prices which includes an element of indirect costs
	- A reasonable mark-up on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant should be allowed to cover indirect costs of supervision, site overheads, head office overheads and profit. The result could be more or less than the norm of 15%. A mark-up of 32.25% would be highly unlikely in a competitive market
	- In times of severe market competition, it is unlikely that MC would allow for as high as 15% mark-up on his directs costs of labour, materials and plant. Lower mark-up would be allowed on sub-contract prices. Similar pressure would apply to subcon.
	- If a contractor sub-contracts out, the indirect costs of supervision could in fact be shared between himself and his subcon down the stream
	- Gov GCC do not have this specific percentage. From SFBC 15% on daywork.
	- C & E may order locker directly from supplier to reduce markup

## Question

QUESTION 1: ESTIMATING

(Total: 25 marks)

You are employed in a Quantity Surveying Consultancy company and you are the Project Surveyor for a proposed office development. In a meeting with the Architect, you have been advised that the Client has decided to change the high zone levels of the development into serviced apartments for rental purposes.

- **Part A**
	The Architect has requested a revised Cost Plan in response to the Client’s instruction. The Director-in-charge of this project requests you, as the Project Quantity Surveyor, to list the probable changes to the original design for this instructed revision and prepare the associated indicative costs for discussion with the Architect.
	
	_(A copy of the cost plan for the originally proposed office development is attached to this Question 1.)_
	
	Background Information
	
	Originally proposed office development:
	
	1. Grade A Commercial Development with a Construction Floor Area of 96,960m².
	2. Total number of levels = 50:
	    - Levels 1 to 4: Building Lobby and Shopping Arcade / Catering Area
	    - Levels 5 to 20: Low Zone rental offices
	    - Levels 21 to 35: Mid Zone rental offices
	    - Levels 36 to 50: High Zone rental offices
	3. Reinforced concrete structure with glazed curtain wall as the external façade.
	
	_(16 marks)_

- **Part B**
	After a preliminary discussion, the Architect wishes to include the following further changes in discussions with the Client in a meeting tomorrow:
	
	1. To change the floor height of Levels 48 and 50 from the typical 4.0m to 5.0m.
	    - The Architect confirmed that this change would not affect the height restriction of the proposed building development.
	2. To add an indoor leisure swimming pool of irregular shape (approximately 20m × 15m) at Level 50 for the enjoyment of the serviced apartment tenants.
	
	Your Task:
	
	List all probable design changes that are considered cost significant and provide the associated indicative costs, with your build-up, for these two changes for discussion in tomorrow’s meeting.
	
	_(6 marks)_

- **Part C**
	In the meeting, the Client was pleased with the idea of adding a leisure swimming pool but commented that the total estimated construction cost was too high and has requested the Architect to propose changes to save cost.
	
	The Architect has requested you to advise him of any likely cost savings that could be made but without changing the functions of the building. In the form of a letter, please suggest some changes to the Architect, with rough indications of cost, for his consideration.
	
	(3 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Architectural and structural
		- Reasonable assumptions on the need to change floor heights and different facade treatment to service apartment floors; any change in loading and therefore any structural strengthening / saving.
		- Change in the vertical structural elements from office floors (with fewer but bigger perimeter columns as in typical office) to serviced apartment (with more but leaner columns / internal structural walls)
		- Addition of a substantial amount of internal partitions and internal doors for the serviced apartment
		- Addition of a substantial amount of toilet provisions for the serviced apartments (waterproofing to floors, wall and floor tiling, sanitary fittings, potable and flushing water supplies)
		- Change of internal finishes from office areas (with bare finishes) to service apartments (fully finished), including provision to the suspended ceiling, revision to flooring system, and wall finishes
		- Built-in fixtures for the services apartments (addition of pantry, fixed furniture - storage cabinet, mirror)
		- Full fitting out of the common areas in the high zone (walls, floors, ceiling to lift lobbies, corridors)
		- FF&E for the serviced apartment and front of house areas including linen, drapery, allowance for cutlery, furniture, decorations
		- Back of house provision including areas for housekeeping, laundry and ironing, food catering / kitchen, etc.
		- Increase the BWIC provisions as there are obviously more E&M works to be installed in serviced apartment than in an office
		- Addition of appliances to serviced apartment - fridge, television sets, hotplates / cooking ranges
		- Pipe ducts for mechanical ventilation of toilets / pantry exhaust
		- The need for an reception area and management office for the exclusive use of the tenants of the service apartments
		- Tourist bus lay-by area for loading / unloading
	- Building services - change in population density and mode will mean changes to the original building services design, including
		- Plumbing and drainage 
			- Pipe sizing and arrangement (toilet arrangement from centralized as in office to room-by-room in serviced apartments)
			- Addition of hot water provision for serviced apartment
			- Revision to underground drainage provisions due to substantial addition of toilets in serviced apartment
		- Electricity provisions
			- Revision to electrical and ELV distribution systems
			- Revision to electrical loading between office and serviced apartment
			- Major revision to lighting and power supplied to serviced apartments
			- Revision to security provisions
		- MVAC system
			- Revision of cooling load of central A/C system, including 24 hours A/C for serviced apartment but not for office, leading to change in chiller provisions
			- Need for mechanical ventilation for toilets / pantry exhaust where provision of openable windows not possible due to layout
		- Sprinkler and AFA provisions
		- Vertical transportation requirement
			- Revision to lift numbers and allocation; with high zone lifts for the exclusive use of the tenants of the serviced apartments, and any need for addition of service lifts
		- Town gas provision in serviced apartment
	- Method of cost estimating
		- On a cost per area basis - e.g. assuming HK$3,000-5,000/m2 for fitting out of the serviced apartment
		- On a cost per unit basis - e.g. assuming HK$15,000-30,000/unit for the provision of sanitary fittings for each toilet
		- On a percentage mark-up of other items - e.g. assuming a revised percentage on BWIC works
		- On the basis of cost advice from A / SE / BSE - e.g. a revised lump sum adjustment for the possible revised 24 hour air-conditioning provision on the revised lift arrangement
		- On a presumed measurement basis - e.g. assuming the addition of 6 - 8 doors per unit of serviced apartment - around HK$30,000-40,000 per unit for approx a total of 180 units (with each unit at around 120m2).
	- Need to show an attempt and effort on quantification of certain architectural and structural items. A mere percentage or elemental unit rate adjustment for all changes with no reasonable elaboration should be marked down 
- B
	- Increase floor height
		- Impact on structure & foundation due to increased wind loading as a result of increased height
		- Impact on external facade due to the change in floor height of 3 levels
		- Impact on the electrical installation - in particular the lighting provisions for maintaining the desirable lighting intensity
		- Impact on MVAC installation due to the increased room volume
		- Impact on the fire services installation - addition of sprinkler provisions, fire detection system, etc., in particular if the increase in depth of suspended ceiling from the structural slab necessitates another layer of sprinklers
		- Impact on vertical architectural elements due to the increase in floor-to-suspended ceiling height
	- Add indoor swimming pool
		- Impact on structure and foundation of the building due to the further increased superimposed load from the pool
		- Reduction in the number of guestrooms for accommodation of the swimming pool
		- Addition of a swimming pool compound including changing room, pump room, acoustic provision, etc.
		- Pool filtration, circulation and sterilization system, pool topping up system and discharge system, and associated water pipe work; associated building structure to house the equipment
		- Impact on the air conditioning and mechanical ventilation requirement in the swimming pool area - increase ventilation and air conditioning to maintain acceptable humidity level
		- Lighting provisions in the indoor swimming pool area
		- Possible glazed enclosure to the pool area
	- State the cost estimate is only preliminary
- C
	- To reduce the specification of materials
		- Wall finishes in E&M plant  rooms, pumps room from plaster and paint to paint on concrete
		- Floor finishes in office from raised floor to carpet tiles on cement and sand paving
	- To take out the suspended ceiling in office rental area
	- To take out the air duct and insulation associated with the fan coil units / VAV units 
	- To take out the light fittings installation (except for emergency lighting) in office rental area and charge to the tenant upon rental
	- To change the swimming pool from indoor to outdoor to save the HVAC and fire services provisions

## Question

QUESTION 2 MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES AND DOCUMENTATION

(total 25 marks)

- 2 A
	You are a quantity surveyor in a property development company and you are assisting the Senior Project Manager in looking after aspects of tender documentation and procurement issues for a high-rise residential project with a two-level basement carpark occupying around 50% of the site area. The professional consultant quantity surveyor employed by your company has just submitted a draft of the firm Bills of Quantities which are ready for issue to the tenderers for tendering purposes. This set of Bills of Quantities has also been priced by the professional consultant quantity surveyor, based on market rates, to provide a pre-tender estimate.
	
	You note that the Bills of Quantities contain a number of departures from the Hong Kong Standard Method of Measurement of Building Works (Third Edition 1979), with special preambles drafted to cover these departures. Upon raising the same to the attention of the Senior Project Manager, he now wants to have your comments on the following before deciding whether or not to adopt the Bills of Quantities as measured for tendering:
	
	- i) How the measured items deviate from the Standard Method?  
	- ii) Any reasons for the consultant quantity surveyor making such departures, apart from saving time in the BQ preparation?  
	- iii) What are the possible concerns of the Employer?  
	- iv) Any suggested improvements to address the concerns of the Employer given in iii) above?
	
	The departures which you have noticed are:-
	
	- 1.1 Timber doors including frames, painting and door ironmongery, etc., are all given as a composite item and ENUMERATED and reference is made to the tender drawings. (3 marks)
	- 1.2 All plumbing pipes of various pipe diameters are each separately measured RUN on plan and the rates for the plumbing pipes are to include for all bends, tees and other fittings. Such rates shall also include for any additional service runs and/or fittings required to route locally around beams, columns or change in levels etc., to suit the building structure or architectural details. (3 marks)
	- 1.3 Man-holes are ENUMERATED and the rates are to include excavation and backfilling, concrete, formwork, reinforcement, benching, finishes, step irons, manhole covers and sleeves, etc. (3 marks)
	- 1.4 External wall tiles, screeds, bedding mortar and jointing and pointing with tile adhesive system are all measured SUPER as a single composite item. (3 marks)

- 2 B
	After giving your comments on the above, the Senior Project Manager now asks you to compile a list of criteria to be considered when streamlining and simplifying the measurement rules in the Standard Method of Measurement for your in-house quantity surveyors to follow when preparing Bills of Quantities. (4 marks)

- 2 C
	Your Senior Project Manager has written a memo to you enquiring about the possible reasons why in the draft Bills of Quantities the temporary works for structural steel shoring, sheet piling and other earthwork support items for the construction of the two-level basement are measured as a lump sum ITEM for the Contractor to design and construct, notwithstanding there is a design and a set of detailed drawings produced by the consultant structural engineer for such works. He also seeks your advice on the essential issues to be included in the draft tender documents in conjunction with such documentation method.
	
	He also noted that the size and exact location of the basement are still subject to the final decision of his top management, which would not likely be finalized before tender return. In light of this, he asked for your advice on the appropriateness of the above method of documentation and any suggested alternatives to deal with this situation.
	
	(5 marks)

- 2 D
	You are the consultant quantity surveyor preparing the tender for the proposed high rise residential development described in A) above. The Architect for the project has designed the external façade of the podium to be fully clad with bevelled edge granite cladding, and has, during a project meeting, presented a sample of the proposed cladding from a particular European quarry to the Employer for approval. The Architect informed the Employer that the indicative supply rate would be about $1,200/m2. The Employer has approved the sample but enquired whether the hue and pattern of the sample would be commonly found in the quarry. This is something the Architect has yet to check.
	
	In a recent letter to your office, the Employer’s Senior Project Manager asked for your advice as to the prime cost rate to be used for tendering purposes, and enquired what information would need to be obtained from the supplier for such purpose.

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Measurement of doors in set
		- Reason
			- In line with the trade practice that doors are very often manufactured and priced in sets including frames and painting etc. 
			- Such measurement method helps to eliminate errors in quantification
		- Concern
			- No detailed breakdown to facilitate valuation of variations of the components within the composite items, e.g. change in ironmongery
		- Improvement
			- Include PC rates for the more cost significant items such as supply of ironmongery items to facilitate future changes
			- Request a breakdown of the composite rate for purpose of future payment valuation and variations
	- All-inclusive linear rate for pipeworks
		- Departure
			- Under SMM bends, tees and other fittings are normally measured by number as extra over the pipework except for PVC pipes, mild steel pipes and plastic pipes. Fittings for pipes which do not exceed 40mm in diameter are held to be included in the item of pipework, the fittings are enumerated as extra over the pipework
			- Under SMM, qty of pipework is normally measured net as fixed in place
		- Reason
			- Simplify the measurement, remeasurement, variations and final account procedures. Adopted to suit the practical problem that normal services schematic and layout drawings are not drawn to such detail where all the fittings can be readily identified and that the exact length of the pipework reticulations can be accurately measured as fixed in place without detail coordination between services and the architectural and structural drawings
			- The percentage deviation in measurement using the modified method as compared to the actual pipework lengths routing around architectural and structural members as fixed in place only represents a small and insignificant figure, which can be readily absorbed by C's pricing during tendering. 
		- Concern
			- The large diameter fittings are cost significant items and should be measured separately. If not, such risks will be loaded in the rates by tenderers, resulting in a possible wide range of rates due to different allowances in tenders
			- There will be no rates for fittings to facilitate valuation of variations
		- Improvement
			- Fittings for large diameter pipe e.g. over 40mm to be measured separately
			- Group pipework in plant rooms or other congested areas (where more fittings such as bends and tees are expected due to reticulation) under a heading stating the location
	- Measurement of manholes in number
		- Departure
			- Under SMM, excavation, backfilling, concrete, formwork, reinforcement, benching, fixtures, step irons, manhole covers and sleeves are each to be measured separately
		- Reason
			- It is trade practice for the estimator to price manholes by number as the variations within this component are comparatively cost insignificant 
		- Concern
			- As the drainage section within BQ is mostly measured as provisional owing to the comparatively higher susceptibility to change, the likelihood of using pro-rata rates is high and such measurement method will not provide adequate cost information for such exercise
		- Improvement
			- For massive or non-standard manholes these can be measured in detail
			- Even if measured by number, there should be a range of manhole depths and cross-sectional size categorizations to give more cost parameters for tendering and post contract purposes
			- Tenderers can be asked to give a rate breakdown of the enumerated item
	- Composite item for external tiling system
		- Departure
			- Under SMM, given separately
		- Reason
			- The composite item will ensure that the whole finishing system is measured without anything being missed out, and all sundry materials and fixing compound required for the proper fixing of the external wall tiles are included for pricing by C as a composite rate
			- It is common that proprietary tiling adhesive system comprises out only the bedding material, but also the screeding to the substrate finished to receive the bedding. A composite item will ensure that the whole system is included in the rate
			- It is common practice for a guarantee to be provided by C for the performance of proprietary tile adhesive system. A composite item including the system with a clear heading stating "subject to guarantee" will give C a clear picture of the extent of the items to be covered by the guarantee. With the screeding measured separate, it may result in such guarantee requirement for the screed being missed out
		- Concern
			- No detailed breakdown to facilitate the valuation of work done and variations of the components within the composite items
		- Improvement
			- To include PC rates for the supply of external wall tiles to facilitate future changes
			- To ask for a rate breakdown of the composite rate before award
- B
	- Speeding up the measurement time for those relatively cost insignificant items
	- Speeding up the tender estimation / pricing time in providing a realistic price
	- Conforming to the trade practice of manufacturing or pricing
	- Reducing risk of claims and disputes
	- Overcoming deficiencies contained in design information or resolving practical problems in assessment or remeasurement of final account
	- Item to be included in the composite rate would preferably be inferred from the quantity of the main item
	- The transfer of risks of items not measured can be reasonably allowed by C's estimator and included in his rates for the principal items
	- After simplifying the standard rules, there should be mechanisms to allow the establishment of cost bases for future assessment of variations
	- The intention and simplified rules must be clearly given in a preamble clause
- C
	- Contractor v Engineer design
		- The shoring, sheet piling and other earthwork support items are temporary work items, the design responsibility of which usually lies with C pursuant to the CC / SP unless specifically stipulated otherwise in the tender doc
		- However, leaving the whole design to C would run the following risks
			- C will only commence his design works and subsequent approval and consent processing after contract awards, thereby lengthening the overall project duration
			- The tenderer's design assumptions for tendering purposes could sometimes be too aggressive (usually reflected by a low allowance in the tender), resulting in protracted resubmissions during construction, delay to the contract and heavy financial burden to C as a result of his underpricing
		- In order to minimize the above risks, some E will have the ELS designed by their consulting engineering in advance and have the BD approval processed
		- However, even with an approved ELS design before the award of contract, E still faces the following risks
			- The consent to be given by BD for actual commencement of ELS works may be conditional upon certain pre-conditions to be fulfilled by C (such as satisfactory submission of the C's site safety plan, completion of site hoarding, etc.). This could cause a disputable split of contractual liability in the event in obtaining the consent
			- Engineer's design may not necessarily represent a economical design, and E may opt to tap into tenderer's input and expertise for a better design
			- As the design of ELS is by E's consultant, should there be any need for further revision to the design, all time and cost implication will be E's liability
		- Given the above, a possible solution for E is to have his consulting engineer to design the ELS and process the BD approval on the one hand, but to transfer the design risk to C through tender documentation
	- Issues to be addressed in tender doc
		- Definition that the design responsibility and obligation to obtain necessary approval and consent rests with the Contractor
		- Stipulation of the availability of an Engineer's design, with reference drawings, calculations etc., to be made available for tenderer's reference
		- State clearly if there is any BD approval already processed / obtained in respect of the Engineer's design
		- C is at liberty to adopt the Engineer's design but must assume all responsibilities as if such design is his own
		- C may adopt another alternative design of his own but must bear all time and cost implications for submissions, waiting time for approval and consent, etc.
	- Possible change to size and location of basement
		- As the size and alignment of the basement is still subject to change and would not be finalized before tender return, the Engineer's design including any approval or consent so far obtained will likely be subject to change
		- Such susceptibility to change will undermine the basis of the above tender documentation method which aims at risk transfer, and therefore render it not appropriate
		- C cannot be asked to price a lump sum item for earthwork support for a basement whose size and alignment is not finally decided
		- A possible method in this instance is to ask QS to prepare a set of provisional qty based on Engineer's design for pricing by tenderers so as to establish a basis for remeasurement in the post contract stage when the basement design is completed and works constructed
- D
	- The information from supplier to architect could be very preliminary and indicative
	- To avoid a large divergence between the actual supply rate and the PC rate used, the following information should be clarified with the supplier:-
		- Whether the supply rate is inclusive of 
			- Cutting the granite cladding to size
			- Cutting and forming bevelled edges, and associated polishing
			- Cutting of fixing pockets / slots
			- Matching shades, hues and pattern as the sample supplied to the Architect
			- Sealer to surface of the granite cladding
		- The joint width allowed (affect actual qty for large areas)
		- Finance charges for the supplier to meet the payment terms of MC
		- Freight charges
		- Special conditions and terms of payment 
		- Whether rate is inclusive of any custom clearance, royalties and duties
		- Supplier's responsibility for the delivery to site, including unloading to the street level of the site
		- Returning packing materials and payment of transport charges
		- Unit rates for additional qty that may need to be ordered for wastage, maintenance or defects rectification during and after the DLP

QUESTION 3 SUB-CONTRACTING SYSTEMS (total 25 marks)

The economic recession has been hanging over Hong Kong for the past several years. The financial difficulties faced by Main Contractors, Sub-contractors and even workers have made news often enough to catch the attention of your lay client, who has commissioned you as the consultant Q.S. for a privately funded exhibition centre with a strong aesthetic appeal. While the project is at its planning stage, your client is keen to know the different types of Sub-contracting systems and how they can be put to beneficial use in light of the recovering economy in Hong Kong. He is confused with the different Sub-contracting systems in use in the current forms of construction contract which contains terminology such as “domestic Sub-contractors”, “specialist Subcontractors”, “named Sub-contractors”, “nominated Sub-contractors” and “nominated suppliers”.

- 3 a
	Explain to your client the pros and cons of adopting the different types of Subcontractor/supplier systems. (5 marks) 

- 3 b
	Your client is very concerned about the tight construction programme and the high aesthetic appeal required for this project. The project manager has advised the use of domestic Sub-contractors for the whole of the project so that the Main Contractor will take full responsibility for the performance of all of his Subcontractor’s. Your client requests your comments on the project manager’s advice. (7 marks)  

- 3 c
	Due to the requirement of high aesthetic appeal for this project, it was decided that named Sub-contractors would be included in the tender documents for the exterior façade. The Main Contractor has confirmed the use of a named Subcontractor at the tender stage. However, during the construction period, the named Sub-contractor went into liquidation halfway through the construction of the exterior façade. No other named Sub-contractor was willing to complete the remaining works. 
	
	The only option that appears to be feasible at this time is to complete the remaining work by employing the labour-only Sub-contractor who used to work for the named Sub-contractor and using the materials that were all delivered to the site. As a client’s Q.S. (or as the Contractor’s Q.S.) prepare a report on the current situation, state the considerations which are required to adopt the above option with the purpose of minimizing future disputes and exposure to excessive cost and describe the steps to be taken if it were to be implemented.
	
	(7 marks)

- 3 d
	Your client is planning the second phase of this exhibition centre, which will be tendered as a separate contract. Since a specially made glass façade was constructed by company ‘A” in phase one of the project, your client has requested your advice on the appropriate contract arrangement to ensure that the second phase of the exhibition centre will be constructed without compromising the consistency of the exterior glass wall but avoiding the down side of adopting a nominated Sub-contract system. (6 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Responsibility for and control of payment to subcon
	- Responsibility for subcon's performance including arrangement for insurance, performance bond, sample submissions, lead time for ordering of materials, fabrication of material and timely delivery of materials to site
	- Decision on the choice of materials
	- Control on negotiations of the value of variations
	- Responsibility for down payments to subcon
	- Coordination of subcon's work with MC's activity
	- Coordination of design drawings which may affect MC's works
	- Cost negotiations in design and the choice of alternative materials
- B
	- It will be very convenient if MC can manage subcon to complete the project so that the responsibility for completing the whole project will be under one umbrella, i.e. MC. However, there are risks associated with such an arrangement as follows:
		- Management capability of MC with respect to subcon management
		- Whether or not MC has the knowledge and ability to select the most appropriate subcon
		- Whether MC can have access to the appropriate subcon
		- MC's selection criteria will predominantly be cost rather than quality
		- MC will not consider better options for E even if such options are available
		- The programme for awarding a subcontract is in the hands of MC. The mismanagement of this programme will have undesirable consequences on the progress of the whole main contract.
		- Subcon's organizations are normally smaller and less knowledgeable than MC's organizations. MC could possibly mistreat subcon to the MC's advantage. The main contract will therefore possibly suffer from quality and progress problems
		- E has no control on the timing and amount of payment for subcon. Mismanagement by MC may adversely affect the performance of even the most competent subcon
		- Many specialist subcon require a long lead time for the manufacture of custom products. E is relieved from the financial burden of paying the deposits that are often required from these specialist subcon. However, such responsibility for payment is transferred to MC and as a result will increase the cost of the tender. In the vent that MC has not allowed for such payments to the specialist subcon, the choice of subcon would be limited
		- In the event of default by a subcon, E is not required to take responsibility for the consequences to the main contract of such default. However, that may not be in the best interest of E who would want to see MC in trouble and the time for completion exposed to potential delay
		- There is no control on MC's mark up on a particular sub-contract, nor their charge for attendance
- C
	- Due to the involvement of named subcon, there may be a possible liability on the part of E for the performance of the subcon. Notwithstanding the possibility, from the point of view of benefit to all parties in the contract, there are following measures:
		- Produce a report on the progress of the works including materials on site, the completion status on the installed works, materials ordered with shipment underway, remaining orders that are yet to be issued by subcon to the manufacturer. This report should included a detailed check on materials that were already manufactured and delivered to site in terms of compliance with specification
		- Produce a report on the status of outstanding design, which may affect the materials required for this project
		- Check the status of payment to subcon, separating the different amounts paid for design, material and installation. Similar checks should be performed by making enquiries with the manufacturer
		- Prepare a scope of work for re-tendering the subcon in which reference should be made to a joint survey of the completion status and an allowance for the cost of providing a warranty for works which were not completed by the new subcon. If it is not feasible to re-tender the project due to pressure of time to complete the works, it is desirable to discuss with MC the possibility of him taking up the responsibility for completing the works while providing a warranty as required in the contract
		- Clarify and agree with MC the different areas of non-performance on the part of subcon in default so that there is a basis on which the future possible cost imbursement to the MC or otherwise can be assessed
		- Discuss with MC and confirm the future programme requirements for completion of the whole project
- D
	- Downside of adopting a NSC system:
		- Long lead time for award NSC
		- E is responsible for delays caused by NSC (not in new SFBC)
		- E has to coordinate the design interface between the NSC and MC works
		- E has to clearly demarcate the design responsibility between the different sections of the works
		- The timing for nominating the subcon will almost always be in the early stage of main contract to avoid delay to the main contract works. However such early nomination of the subcon will reduce the amount of time that is available to the designer who may make better decisions if such additional time is made available
	- Alternative
		- Use of a "PC item" followed by an explanation on how PC items can be operated to achieve the purpose
		- Negotiate with the existing subcon for an acceptable price to form a contract which can at a later date be novated to MC. Such novation should be specified in main contract as part of the contractual obligation for acceptance by MC

## Question

QUESTION 4 PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE (total 25 marks)

- 4 a
	During the last stage of the construction contract of a 36 storey residential building, and in response to the sign of an up-swing in the property market, the Employer intends to launch the sale of the property 3 months from now, and, to suit his sales programme, to have four flats on the 23rd floor fitted out as show flats by a fitting out specialist contractor. The current status of completion of the Main Contract works is as follows:
	
	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250401212806.png)
	
	The Date for Completion under the Contract was 2 months ago, and according to the Main Contractor’s latest programme, the remaining works will take another 3 to 4 months to complete. The Employer is eager to commence the show flat fitting out works as soon as possible, and has raised the following in a letter for your advice as the consultant QS:
	
	i/ Upon preliminary discussion with the Main Contractor, the Architect reported that the Main Contractor was very reluctant to accept the introduction of another contractor on site. Can the Main Contractor reject entry into the site of a separate contractor? (2 marks)  
	
	ii/ What possible contractual risks and/or claims would arise as a result of the introduction of the fitting out works? (4 marks)  
	
	iii/ What would be the suggested alternative arrangement(s) that could on the one hand minimize disturbance to the Main Contractor and on the other have the fitting out specialist contractor start work soonest? (3 marks)  
	
	iv/ What issues should be considered if the Employer intends to open the show flats to the public upon their completion, while the Main Contract works have still not been completed? (4 marks)

- 4 b
	Your office was appointed by the newly elected Committee of the Incorporated Owners (IO) of a large residential estate as the Consultant QS to handle issues in relation to certain A&A works on the estate.
	
	i/ The IO intends to arrange a tender for the upgrading of floor and wall finishes to typical lift lobbies in the residential towers, and asked for your early advice on matters relating to contractual issues and preliminaries which need to be addressed in the tender documents and the subsequent contract in connection with the works. No particular form of contract has been decided on yet, but it is expected that the usual essential clauses of the traditional forms of contract will prevail. (6 marks)
	
	ii/ the IO chairman noted from the attestation of the Articles of Agreement in the HKIA/HKIS Form the wording “ As witness the hands of the said parties …”, and was not sure of its meaning and purpose. He also enquired if there is any other mode of contract execution and the pros and cons of each mode. (3 marks)
	
	iii/ It was finally decided to execute the contract as a deed. Before such execution you are required by your Director to draft certain guidelines and a checklist for your team members as a reference to deal with the different modes of execution by the contracting parties to ensure the execution of the contract is legally binding. (3 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Expected to base answers on private SFBC
	- (i)
		- Clause 30 of SFBC requires MC to permit the execution of work not forming part of the contract by a Specialist Contractor engaged by E. MC has therefore no contractual ground to reject entry into the site of IFO contractor.
	- (ii)
		- Financial claims for attendance to be provided by MC to the separate contractor, which would including coordination on programme, provision of storage facilities, vertical transportation for material and labour, use of toilet facilitates, cleaning, etc.
		- By such late instruction, MC would likely be claiming for EOT for any delay to his own works by the separate contractor through clause 25.1(p)
		- MC could also claim EOT from the original date for completion to the date of introducing the separate contractor, as the disruption happened within the C's own delaying period (i.e. the gross extension). While the legal validity of such claim is yet subject to debate, E may also rely on the decision of Chestermont v Balfour for a defense (i.e. for a net extension only).
		- Upon the introduction of the IFO contractor to carry out the IFO works for the four show flats, difficulty would arise as to the split of liability for any defects within these flats which may come up, making it difficult to enforce either party (MC and IFO) to come back to carry out rectification works
	- (iii)
		- As MC's own finishing work to 23/F has not started yet, the original finishing works to the units can be carried out also by IFO contractor, thereby eliminating the split liability problem
		- IFO works can be arranged as a NSC. However, this would trigger a claim for late nomination.
		- As no PC sum / pro sum is allowed in the contract, MC's consent to such introduction will have to be sought.
		- Attendance will have to be paid to MC and also MC is entitled to profit and overhead as well.
		- Suggest that E lowers the show flats to completed floors below 10th floor, thereby minimizing disturbance to MC's works. However, this would mean E losing benefit of upper floor show flats with better views.
	- (iv)
		- The site is still under possession by MC, introducing the public into the site prior completion will need MC's agreement, unless the same arrangement has already been stipulated in the contract
		- The site is still a construction site, and further consideration should be given to any requirement for a temporary occupation permit for those areas to be opened to public. This will include related issues such as:
			- The dedicated and protected access
			- Means of escape (which may be different from those for the project upon completion)
			- Fire protection
			- Effective means of separation from the rest of the construction site etc.
		- The introduction of the public will cause disruption to MC's progress of the remaining work (including disruption to access, extra protection, possible stoppage of work during opening period, etc.), thereby giving an excuse to MC for EOT
		- Extra protection and enhancement works for marketing purposes (including possibly addition of sales office on site)
		- E will need to take possession of the show flats and possibly the whole 23rd floor to facilitate such opening, by trigger clause 18 partial possession by Employer. Upon doing so, E will have to consider the insurance of the portion taken in his possession through his own Property All Risk Insurance and TPI.
		- C should be asked to draw the attention of his CAR insurer of such increase risk and to obtain an endorsement from the insurer to such effect
- B
	- (i)
		- Contractual 
			- Date for Possession needs to be amended to the effect that MC is not actually taking possession of the lobbies, but to only commence work there
			- Liability for indemnity against loss and damage to existing properties arising out of the carrying out of the works needs to be considered. E can either choose to take up the risk, or to ask C to indemnify him for such loss and damage
			- Requirement for the arrangement of insurances to match the liabilities for indemnity. This will include extending E's own Properties All Risk Policy with an endorsement to cover loss and damages as a result of the A&A works. Should C be required to provide the indemnity, section II of CAR will need to be extended to cover E's properties.
			- Possible phased completion
				- LD defined
				- DLP defined as a fixed period from the completion of the last batch / different DLP for different phases
				- release of retention defined 
			- Payment in stages or by progress payment
		- Preliminaries
			- Access restriction including 
				- Restricted use of lifts and staircases, e.g. designated lift for the works
				- Loading restriction on the use of lift
				- Responsibility for extra maintenance and repair and attendance by lift maintenance contractor
			- Responsibility for protection of lifts and staircases and extent of protection required
			- Availability of temporary water and electricity from E's own source, or to be separately metered and charged back to C. Responsibility for temporary connection and fees and charges for consumption for the works
			- Working hours, restriction on noisy works
			- Detail control of workpeople in and out the estate and the residential towers
				- Use of an access control system including ID registration daily
				- Uniforms / ID badges to be worn at all times by workers on site
			- Storage area availability, restriction on the size / location / loading restriction of the storage area
			- Temporary protection of existing premises and liability for damage caused
			- Daily cleaning of debris arising from the works, daily cleaning after working hours
			- In-house rules
			- Any requirement for a team of customers relationship officers to handle complaints and for daily arrangement
	- (ii)
		- The wording as quoted are used for execution of a simple contract, a contract which is not executed as a deed (i.e. not under seal). The contract execution will usually be witnessed to signify the authenticity of the persons signing the contract
		- The other mode of contract execution is a contract under seal (a specialty contract).
		- Under Chapter 347 Limitation Ordinance, actions founded on simple contract are subject to a limitation period of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued. This includes one contracting party's legal action against the other defaulting party for damages as a result of breach of contract. For a specialty contract or a sealed contract, the limitation period is 12 years.
		- Usually, C will look upon a sealed contract as carrying a heavier liability upon them owing to the longer exposure to the other party's action, and therefore, a higher price theoretically.
		- Furthermore the procedural complexity of executing a sealed contract in certain corporations may deter the use of such form
		- For A&A works arranged by IO for the estate, to maximize the protection to the owners of the estate, a sealed contract may be more desirable
	- (iii)
		- Checking is to establish the legal capacity of the signatories, so that the contract when executed is legally binding and enforceable
		- For parties executing the contract as a deed, the following documents should be checked:
			- For a sole proprietor, or unincorporated body, the person or the partners of the unincorporated body should all sign and a red circular sticker or wafer (replacing the previous was + seal) should be affixed beside the signatures.
			- For a body corporate, the company memorandum should be checked to identify the specified manner for executing a deed. Usually the body corporate will resolve to have a deed executed by the affixation of the company's common seal or corporate seal, plus the signature and/or the witnessing of execution by the authorized signatories in accordance with the Articles of Association or other constructional documents of the parties. There would usually be a Board Meeting approving the execution of the agreement. Hence, to ensure the legal capacity of the signatories and the effectiveness of the execution, the company memorandum, the Articles of Association and the Board Resolution must be checked.
			- The body corporate may also authorize a Power of Attorney to execute a deed. This is usually the case if the body corporate is incorporated overseas. In this case, the Power of Attorney should be carefully checked to authenticate the authority of the signatory

## Question

(total 25 marks)

In this question, you are to assume the respective roles as described in each part of the question.

The project involves a residential development estimated to cost $300,000,000, with a contract period of 30 months.

- **Part A – Preliminaries**
	You are the project quantity surveyor of the consultant QS for the project. In the analysis of tenders for the superstructure submitted last month, your assistant QS has compiled the attached table comparing the allowances by the lowest three tenderers for the various preliminaries items in the tender.
	
	Upon receiving the comparison, the Employer’s project manager has asked for your advice on the following:
	
	1.A1) For item 16.0, the second lowest tenderer didn’t price anything for insurances and bond. How should this issue and other unpriced items be dealt with? (2 marks)
	
	1.A2) For item 14.05, there is a vast difference between the lowest tenderer’s allowance and those of the other two. What would be a reasonable allowance, and how should it be assessed? (2 marks)
	
	1.A3) Adequate site management by the Main Contractor is the project manager’s key concern for this project. Without referring to the details in the tender documents and before asking the tenderers, what is your preliminary advice and comments on the allowances by the respective tenderers on this issue? What approach would you take to come up with your comments? (2 marks)
	
	1.A4) For item 18.02 – hoarding, the allowance by the lowest tenderer is obviously an overpricing, considering the existing hoarding is already provided under the previous foundation contract. What is the likely exposure to the Employer in this regard, and what measures should be taken to protect the Employer’s interest? (2 marks)

- **Part B - Employer's supplied materials**
	The Employer intends to order and purchase direct from an overseas tile manufacturer specially kilned tiles with unique colour and surface features as cladding to the external walls of the podium and lowest 3 floors of the residential towers. Such tiles are to be handed over to and installed by the Main Contractor as part of the main contract works. As his consultant QS, he asked for your advice on any issues that should be addressed in the supply contract and in the Main Contract tender documents to protect the Employer’s interests. (5 marks)

- **Part C - Main Contractor's in-house rules**
	You are a quantity surveyor working in a fire services contracting company. Your company has recently been nominated by the Employer under an Architect’s instruction to the Main Contractor for a Nominated Sub-contract to carry out the fire services works in the residential development project. Yesterday, your boss received the following letter from the Main Contractor about their in-house rules.
	
	After discussion with your boss, you are asked to
	
	1.C1) write a memo to advise him on your company’s position; (4 marks)  
	1.C2) draft a letter in reply to the Main Contractor’s letter (2 marks)

	![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250401213427.png)

- **Part D - Completion Certificate**
	The project is approaching completion. In early July 2005, the Main Contractor has encountered his own delay to the Works due to defects rectification required by the Architect as a result of hairline cracks appearing in the plaster and paint in the typical lobbies. The Main Contractor anticipates that the original Works could only be completed by end September 2005.
	
	At the same time in July 2005, he has also submitted an extension of time (EOT) claim of 60 days in total for the delay due to the Architect’s late instructions for the following items, which are amongst the last items in his programme before completion:
	
	(a) Court surfacing of sports ground  
	(b) Finishing works at entrance lobbies  
	(c) Paving materials to external areas  
	(d) Timber flooring inside flats  
	(e) A/C units inside flats
	
	Such EOT claim, if granted, would have the effect of extending the original date for completion from 31st August 2005 to end October 2005, thereby enabling him to complete the original Works, including the above items, without any delay.
	
	Upon receiving the claim, however, the Architect did not grant EOT to the Main Contractor. Instead, in early September 2005, he issued a Certificate of Practical Completion to the Main Contractor, certifying that the Works were practically completed on 31st August 2005. The Architect listed the above items which were still not completed, plus uncompleted plaster and paint rectification works in the Main Contract, as outstanding works and defects. Accordingly, the EOT claim in respect of the Architect’s late instruction for the above items was also rejected by the Architect.
	
	1.D1) As a quantity surveyor working for the Main Contractor, you are asked by your boss to appraise the situation and comment on the validity of the said Certificate of Practical Completion. (4 marks)
	
	1.D2) The Main Contractor has another public residential building project in hand. The boss of the Main Contractor is also concerned about the implication to the validity of the Certificate of Substantial Completion if the Architect of that public residential building project also handles the matters of extension of time and completion date in the same way as this private residential building project.
	
	As a quantity surveyor working for the Main Contractor, you are required by your boss to advise him on his concerns. Please write a memo as per his request. (2 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- A1
		- Similar insurance requirements are allowed in clause 6.04 of CC.
		- In respect of unpriced prelim items, while there are the usual stipulation in Prelim Bill stating that the cost effects of all unpriced items are deemed to have been made else where in the tender, PQS should highlight any major costs seemingly unpriced / underpriced by the tenderers, and to draw E's attention of any possible major financial exposure to the tenderer. It would be prudent to draw the tenderer's attention to such list to confirm their awareness and their willingness to abide by their tenders. 
	- A2
		- The allowances are govern by the prescribed % in the statutes. Industrial training levies are 0.4% of the contract sum, and pneumoconiosis levy is 0.25%. 
		- The lowest tenderer's allowance is insufficient to cover the levies and obviously underpriced
	- A3
		- Respective allowance under various different headings
			- 5.03 - clause 8 - Foreman in charge
			- 6.13 - MC's management team
			- 17.03 - Foreman in charge
		- While different allowances were made by the tenderers, the candidate should be able to comment on the adequacy to spot any over / under pricing by any tenderer. 
		- Establishing the reasonableness of such allowance should be from first principles, after consultation with the other consultants on reasonable management team to be expected from MC on this project, after consideration of the contract period, complexity of the job, requirements from the tender documents. The candidate is expected to make reasonable assumptions and draw up back-up information in the answer.
	- A4
		- On the comparatively high allowance for hoarding by the lowest tenderer, the candidate is expected to advise the client that such high allowance, if not dealt with before the award of contract, would lead to possible contractual argument as to the amount payable during valuations of payment.
		- The theoretical financial exposure of E should also be mentioned (i.e. payment of an amount in excess of the value to E). 
		- The candidate should be able to pick up the usual way to deal with unreasonably high allowance for prelim items, including pre-agreeing the mode of payment for the balance after payment of the assessed reasonable amount, or payment of the full amount proportionate of the % of work done etc.
- B
	- Issues to be considered
		- Timing and quantity of delivery from supplier to meeting installation programme
		- Clear demarcation of responsibility for defective / damaged materials, and any mechanism to establish same
		- Quantities to ordered, and how to ensure the ordered quantity are sufficient for the works and within bounds of reasonable wastage limits
		- What if there is a need to re-order materials, due to change in design or due to contractor's excessive wastage? How to define time and cost liability?
	- In the supply contract
		- Apart from the usual content of a supply contract, the following interfacing issues should also be addressed:
		- To confirm timing of delivery
		- To confirm supply rate to be valid for a stipulated period, to cater for re-ordering
		- To define the procedure and timing for acceptance of the materials by independent surveyors / loss adjusters at the time of delivery or jointly with the MC during his taking delivery
		- To confirm liability for damaged materials and mechanism for acceptance of materials
	- In the Main Contract
		- An item for take delivery and fix should be measured, with appropriate preamble to highlight that the rate shall include for taking delivery from E's store. If the actual location of the store can be confirmed, such information should be stated.
		- Alternatively, the responsibility for the timing and arrangement of taking delivery can be placed upon MC, but such arrangements will require prior firming up of the delivery terms with the supplier so that each tenderer will receive the same information from the supplier for fair tendering.
		- As E will be responsible to make available to MC the material at appropriate time, the material delivery schedule should be firmed up before hand with the overseas supplier to avoid delaying MC's programme. Such tentative delivery schedule should be stipulated in the MC tender doc.
		- Installation will definitely involve wastage. To avoid contractual dispute due to MC's undesirable high wastage leading to material shortage and extra material supply cost, a preset wastage percentage should be stipulated in the contract, above which MC should be responsible for the time and cost required to overcome any deficit. Alternatively, E's actual ordered quantity can be spelt out in the tender documents with a stipulation requiring MC to be responsible for the time and cost implications for any extra tiles that may be required as a result of his excessive wastage.
		- The tender document should stipulate a mechanism to monitor the quantity of tiles being taken over by MC from E's store, for control of material taken over and as the basis for calculation of wastage.
		- To eliminate possible future argument about liability for damages tiles discovered upon the supplier's delivery of the tiles to site, MC should be asked to inspect tiles before taking delivery and to assume full responsibility for broken tiles.
		- The supply rate as confirm by the overseas supplier should be stipulated in the tender document so that if MC anticipates his wastage would exceed the present percentage, necessitating his placing an additional order with the overseas tile manufacturer, he can price for such risk.
		- Whilst the overseas supplier might have provided E with a guarantee for the tiles, there could be certain manufacturer's instructions for fixing of such tiles associated with such guarantee, failing to comply with which will void the guarantee. Such manufacturer's instruction should be spelt out in the tender documents for MC's compliance.
- C
	- Memo of company's position
		- NSC is obliged to comply with the terms and conditions of Nominated Sub-Contract for which he has submitted a tender to E
		- NSC however is not obliged to comply with any requirements on top of and in addition to those stipulated in Sub-Contract tender document
		- Unless NSC agrees to include the additional requirements, MC cannot force NSC to incorporate such terms and conditions into Sub-Contract
		- If such term and conditions are added, NSC may incur extra costs which would expose him financially
		- In respect of the fines to be imposed for infringement of the stipulated conditions, the candidate should be able to discuss the enforceability of such in law, as these could well be interpreted as penalties, they being not commensurable 相稱 with the loss / damage flowing from non-compliance.
		- MC has the right to reject nomination under main contract. However, the disagreement of NSC to accept additional imposed terms by MC will not be a ground for his exercising such rejection. 
		- Until MC accepts the Architect's nomination, there is still no binding contract between MC and NSC. There is still the fall back situation not to enter into NSC, depending on the explicit wording of the NSC tender form.
		- Any adverse effect on the relationship with MC
	- Letter to MC
		- On the one hand uphold company's position and on the other hand be written in a tactful way so as not to sour the relationship with future MC
		- "We value our relationship with the MC and look forward to a productive and collaborative working relationship. We are open to further discussions to address any concerns and ensure a smooth project execution."
- D
	- D1
		- Intent of each party
			- MC envisaged the EOT for the excusable delay would have given him time to finish the delayed works on his part, thereby escaping his responsibility for LAD to the Employer
			- A by certifying completion cert as the original date for completion in spite of the outstanding defects rectification works and the delayed works caused by his late instruction had the effect of avoiding the granting of EOT for such reason, and the associated L&E that may result
		- Identify the validity of the two categories of "outstanding items" by the Architect
			- One relating to the de minimius and trivial defects rectification not affecting the beneficial occupation of the Employer
				- Case law supports the view that rectification of trivial defects can be treated in the same way as outstanding works if they are in line with the "de minimius" principle
			- The other relating to those which do affect beneficial occupation and which render the issuance of the completion cert questionable
		- SFBC limits the power of A to order the remedying of defects during DLP to those defects "identified during DLP"
		- A's intentional leaving certain outstanding works to be carried out after completion would entitle MC cost reimbursement for any extra preliminaries and/or expenses genuinely incurred. This however has to be distinguished from those resources which MC would otherwise be responsible to provide during DLP for defects rectification. Also, such work will be completed within a reasonable time only.
	- D2
		- GCC is used, allow certain outstanding work to be completed within a period as reasonably directed by A
		- No explicit definition of what nature of works could be covered by the A's outstanding work list, but implied terms i.e. fit for intended purpose and ready for Employer's beneficial use, and "de minimius" principle

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Prerequisites
		- The issue of unpaid amount need to be resolved with MC and NSC before alternatives can be arranged
		- MC should not be in favour of determining the main contract unless it is inevitable
		- MC has the right to exercise the contract provision. However, it may be convincing to MC to consider alternatives if he is given some assurance to future payments. Such assurance from Employer can be in the form of a bond from sureties if the Employer can still arrange one
		- Employer may suspend the work by an issue of an AI postponing the execution of the works. This will allow the Employer additional period of time to resolve the funding issue. The suspension should not exceed 120 days, or the contract may be determined.
	- Alternatives
		- Different payment terms than those in the contract, such as partial payment or delayed payment using the operating revenue from the hotel as a guarantee
		- A bank guarantee / bond can be used to restore confidence for continuing with the works, subject to Employer's financial arrangement with his financier
		- A suspension period agreeable to both MC and the Employer during which MC will be paid for material ordered and delivered to site and be reimbursed his loss and damages until funding is resumed. An agreement to catch up with the programme once work is resumed should also be arranged.
		- 1 & 2 will cause least disruption to programme
		- 3 will create some disruption, extent depends on the duration of suspension. Associated L&E and acceleration cost shall be warned.
- B
	- B1
		- Instruction for additional work can only apply to variations within the original scope of works
		- For works outside the original scope of works, a separate agreement is required to incorporate the "additional scope" into the existing contract. This require mutual agreement between the parties and MC is not obliged to agree to such increase in the scope of works
		- A Supplementary Agreement is often used to supplement the original contract with additional scope
		- The original contract has its own contract particulars including site boundary, cost, performance, specification and programming requirements. The additional scope may alter these requirements and such alterations need to be recorded in SA.
			- Redefinition of site boundary
			- Alteration to warranty requirement
			- Cost - cost of interface works
			- Performance - compatibility in specification between the re-cycling plant and the original development
			- Programme - the change in sequence of works to accommodate the commissioning of the recycling plant and the system as a whole. Also, the effect to the original contract programme and contract completion, in particular, if the MC is already in delay in the original contract or there is an EOT claim
			- Associated NSC works affected by the additional works, with similar items as above to be worked out
		- Capability for a building contractor to carry out the plant construction works
	- B2
		- The proper functioning of the whole system now becomes the responsibility of the Employer
		- The specification for the recycling plant and the development project need to be carefully designed to ensure compatibility, in particular, the interfacing of specifications
		- The interface between the recycling plant and the development needs to be arranged if the recycling plant is carried out by another MC
		- Separate packaging would result in additional works in the original main contract like the provision of interfacing builder's works, building services provisions - additional power and interfacing signaling for monitoring and the like
		- The defects liability between the recycling plant and the connecting equipment in the original main contract should also be clearly demarcated and included in an agreement with the original MC and in the contract to be awarded to the separate contractor for the recycling plant

	(A copy of the Simple Cost Analysis of the previous similar project is attached to this Question 1).
	(15 marks)

- **Part B**
	The Employer further advises that he is now contemplating applying for bonus GFA through dedication and there is a possibility of obtaining a bonus GFA of 1,260 m2 . He would like your advice on the following:
	
	a) cost comparison between adding one floor to the building without altering the floor plan, or spreading the bonus GFA equally on each typical floor. (6 marks) 
	
	b) apart from the different initial construction costs, what other considerations should be taken into account when comparing the overall financial viability of the two options mentioned in a) (4 marks)

	- Other considerations
		- Longer programme for additional floor option
		- Higher commercial value of the additional areas in the additional floor option because they are on the top of the building
		- Additional floor option will be easier to implement, and should negotiation for bonus GFA be unsuccessful, disruption to the development and construction process can be kept to a minimum
		- Taller buildings will attract higher future maintenance cost
		- Taller building option will yield large podium area for other functional uses
		- Possible re-design fees
		- Building height restriction
		- Additional development fee for planning approval

#TenderAnalysis #Procurement
## Question

(total 25 marks)

Your client Developer wishes to add a transfer lift tower with two lifts to his existing walk-up 3-level shopping mall in Tsimshatsui, and is working with his leasing agent on the arrangements for temporary termination of leases of affected tenants to facilitate such construction work. Your firm acts as the consultant project quantity surveyor for the Developer for the project.

- **Part A**
	At the request of the Developer, your firm is required to give comments on a preliminary overall project programme of the transfer lift tower prepared by the Developer’s programmer. Your comments are required more specifically on the logic, inter-activity relationship and durations, with the aim of improving the overall programme and to have the transfer lift tower open and in operation before June 2008. A copy of the original programme is attached for reference.
	
	You are required by your Director to mark your comments directly on the attached programme, with your annotation notes fully detailed in an internal memo to your Director. The logic and assumptions are to be stated. (12 marks)

- **Part B**
	In a recent project meeting, you were advised that the Employer would wish to use machine-roomless lifts instead of the original hydraulic lifts for the proposed transfer lift tower. Preliminary information from the Building Services Engineer suggested that using machine-roomless lifts would require 2 extra months for manufacture and delivery of the lifts.
	
	The Employer wishes to seek your opinion on the various alternative procurement arrangements for the lifts to overcome the apparent extra time requirement for using the machine-roomless lifts so that the opening of the transfer lift tower could still be achieved before June 2008. Draft a letter accompanied by a simple programme (to be marked on the space provided in the programme attached in Part A) to illustrate your advice to the Employer which should include an analysis of the risks of the various alternative procurement arrangements and your recommended proposal.
	
	(10 marks)

- **Part C**
	In a recent discussion, the Architect and Engineer proposed to tender out the transfer lift tower contract with the time for completion to be left to the tenderers to fill in in the Form of Tender. The Employer asked how tenders with differing tender amounts and different periods for completion can be compared in order to give a realistic financial comparison. Draft a memo to reply to the Employer’s concern.
	
	(3 marks)

- Appendix not attached

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Site investigation works are to yield underground information to enable the Engineer to design the foundation system and for submission to the statutory authorities (BD) to support the Engineer's foundation proposal. As such, the site investigation works need to be tendered earlier and completed as soon as possible such that the information is available in time for the preparation of the design and submission
	- A two weeks programme for preparation of tender documentation is considered too aggressive
	- Tendering out the whole works (foundation + superstructure) before BD approval may run the risk of not capturing any additional requirements from BD in the tender. As such, tender addendum will be necessary. It would even be worse if the tender return is scheduled before the approval
	- The issuance of the tenders should be after the finalization of the detailed design such that all of the detailed design will be incorporated into the tender documentation
	- There is no reason why steel fabrication starts after completion of the foundation works. Understandably, steel fabrication takes place off site and requires considerable lead time, and should be started as soon as possible and in time for other critical activities such as the lift delivery
	- Lift delivery should also be arranged earlier to be in-line with the completion of the structure and lift machine room for lift installation, and not be left until the completion of the structure
	- A realistic lift fabrication and delivery period would be around 6-7 months, after preparation and submission of shop drawings by the Contractor and approval by the consultants
	- A 90 day lift installation for 2 lifts with only 3 stops would be too long
- B
	- Arrange the lift as a separate contract earlier than the MC programme
		- Problem of co-ordination and liaisons between works of the lift separate contract and the building contract, and the different programmes to tie-in with each other. 
		- In particular the obtaining of statutory approval (Form 6 EMSD) upon satisfactory completion of the lifts is a prerequisite for MC works to obtain OP. 
		- The lifts, if procured under a separate contract, would mean Employer / Consultant have to deal with two separate parties. 
		- Any delay in one contract may affect the other, and vice versa
		- Any mis-matches between the delivery programme of the lifts and the time when the lift shafts / machine rooms are ready for installation, would possibly be grounds for the contractor to claim for off-site storage charges and other related claims
	- Arrange the lift as NSC to the MC, and with the procurement and tendering programme ahead of MC
		- Employer to award NSC on behalf of future MC and the need for subsequent novation agreement of the NSC back to MC
		- MC has the right to object to nomination unless suitable stipulation made in the MC tender document
		- Earlier tender for NSC than MC would mean the need for earlier determination of the MC terms and details
- C
	- Difference in various times for completion in tenders can be capitalized by the rate of LAD in the tender, assuming LAD represents the genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss of each day's delay
	- The longer periods can be converted into a hypothetical value to be added to the tender sum for comparison with other tender amounts
	- LAD may not fully representative of the full / genuine loss and damage that the Employer will suffer in the event of delay. For example, the magnitude of LAD rates may be too large to the extent that they are out of proportion when compared with the tender / contract sum. Therefore, including the full / genuine LAD rates may deter tenderers from tendering. For this reason, using the LAD rate for capitalization may not resulting in a true financial value for comparison. The rate to be used should therefore be confirmed with the Employer to ensure the full rate is used. In this case, the loss of revenue from the termination of the lease is one of the losses to be considered.

#Defect  #Warranty #Variation #TenderDoc 
## Question

(total 25 marks)

- **Part A - Warranty**
	Following a heavy rainstorm, Mr. Tenant, who occupies the penthouse unit of a serviced apartment, discovered water dripping from the ceiling and running down the wall of the living room. Mr. Tenant was very unhappy because the water seepage completely ruined his antique rug, which he had previously purchased at an auction for $250,000.
	
	Mr. Tenant wrote to the Developer, Reliable Estates Ltd. (“REL”), demanding reimbursement for:
	
	- The cost of rectifying the waterproofing, ceiling, and wall finishes
	- The cost of the antique rug
	
	He also threatened legal action if REL refused to pay.
	
	The Project Manager of REL immediately contacted the Main Contractor, Builder & Associates (“B&A”), demanding that B&A should deal with the matter. However, B&A responded with the following:
	
	a. B&A denied responsibility, stating that the waterproofing works were carried out by NSC Ltd., a specialist contractor nominated by the Architect. Therefore, NSC Ltd. Should be responsible for the cost of repairs and damages.  
	
	b. B&A also stated that the waterproofing was tested satisfactorily and accepted by the Architect during the final inspection at the end of the Defects Liability Period.
	
	The Project Manager is concerned about REL’s contractual position, fearing that REL may end up paying the full amount of damages to Mr. Tenant, as there is no direct contractual relationship between REL and NSC Ltd.
	
	A meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow afternoon to discuss the issue. Your Senior Associate asks you to prepare a memo addressing the following key issues likely to be raised by REL during the meeting:
	
	- 3A.1	
		Explain and clarify whether there is a contractual relationship between REL and NSC Ltd. _(5 marks)_
	
	- 3A.2	
		NSC Ltd. Has provided a Warranty for the waterproofing system, a copy of which is attached. Explain to the Project Manager the difference if REL were to rely on:
			The terms and conditions of the Warranty
			The terms under the Sub-Contract
		To obtain remedies from NSC Ltd. For:  
		a) The cost of rectifying the defective waterproofing, ceiling, and wall finishes  
		b) The damage to the ruined antique rug incurred by Mr. Tenant _(5 marks)_
	
	- 3A.3
		Assess the validity of NSC Ltd.'s argument that they are not obliged to rectify the defect, as:
		- It was not included in the Defects List
		- Any previously identified defects had been tested and accepted by the Architect _(3 marks)_

Depending on the degree of seriousness of the offence, contractors could be suspended from tendering public works.
	
	The Government of Hong Kong has introduced the “Pay for Safety and Environment Scheme” (herein referred to as “PFSES”) which aims to further counter problems associated with construction site safety despite the existence of regulations and laws in the present Government system. The Hong Kong Construction Association together with the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong have also launched a safety partnering programme with similar mechanisms on safety aspects.
	
	Your client’s Project Manager would like to know more about the PFSES and how it could improve site safety. Write a brief memo outlining the following issues related to site safety under the PFSES:
	
	3C.1 With the relevant safety and environmental Ordinances already in place, how can the PFSES help the industry in these two areas. (3 marks)  
	
	3C.2 How the PFSES could be incorporated in construction contracts. (3 marks)  
	
	3C.3 Identify at least two elements under the PFSES that are normally included in construction contracts. (1 mark)

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- A1. Contractual relationship
		- There is a contractual relationship between the E and MC; and another contractual relationship between MC and NSC. The object of each of these contractual relationships, or for any contracts, between two parties is to create what is known as privity of contract between them, enabling either of the parties to enforce the contract if there is a breach by the other
		- A third party who is not a party to the contract cannot take advantage of or be liable under the contract unless there is a 'link'
		- The 'link' between Employer and NSC is established by means of a 'warranty' provided by NSC to E in consideration of nomination. The object of a warranty is to give the third party the right to enforce the obligations of a contract although not a party to it
		- By nominating a NSC to MC, E is to ensure that they retain a right of action in contract against the NSC in the event of a breach of the NSC conditions
		- NSC is required to provide a form of warranty to E. It creates a binding contractual relationship between NSC and E to carry out his obligations under NSC conditions int he same manner as that between NSC and MC.
	- A2. Recover the cost of defects and damages to property
		- Replying upon the express terms and conditions of the sub-contract
			- Under SFBC clause, NSC is obliged to rectify all defects that occurred during DLP to the satisfaction of the Architect
			- The obligations under SFBC do not extend to the aforementioned damages resulting indirectly from a consequence of the breach causing the damage. This is because the cost of the damage could be out of proportion when compared with the value of the sub-contract works
			- Employer generally have to seek alternative tortious remedies if they want to pursue the recovery of the cost of damage other than the cost of defects rectification
			- E's action against NSC under the SFBC could be barred upon the issuance of the Final Certificate unless common law actions are brought against NSC.
		- Relying upon the terms of the warranty
			- The terms of warranty extend NSC's obligations beyond those under SFBC
			- Warranty sets out the obligations of NSC which includes the cost of the repair, replacement and restoration of the defective works
			- The warranty requires NSC to warrant the waterproofing system to be free from any deficiencies and defects, both patent and latent
			- In addition, NSC is required to reimburse E the costs of the consequential effects flowing from the said defect
			- NSC's obligation under warranty are still in full force beyond the Final Certificate for 10 years from Certificate of Completion.
	- A3. Not obliged to rectify as the defect was not included in the Defects Lists
		- SFBC require the Architect to prepare a final schedule of defects not later than 14 days after the end of DLP
		- The fact that the defect was not stated in the Defects List, does not rule out the NSC's obligations under the contract nor his common law liability in rectifying the defects
		- Under the limitation ordinance, actions could be brought against the NSC within 6 years for a simple contract from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or within 12 years in the case of contracts under seal
		- The Contractor's liability in damages is not removed by the existence of a defects clause; the latter in practice confers substantial advantages on both contractual parties
		- Defects represent a breach of contract by NSC. The contract conditions when dealing with remedying defects does not in any way specify that the intention is to substitute E's common law remedy for breach.
		- The defects clause does not operate to exclude the NSC's liability nor overrule the provision of the limitation ordinance
		- NSC is still obliged to rectify the defect even if the defect was not included in the Defects Lists
- B
	- Contract conditions empower the Architect to omit the work as variations
	- Under normal circumstances and as a basic principle under the law of contract, a Contractor must be permitted to carry out and complete the whole of the works that he has contracted to carry out, unless expressly stated otherwise. Any works that are omitted but to be let to a third party to be carried out concurrently with the original contract is considered a breach of contract on the part of the Employer
	- If such omitted portion of the works is carried out concurrently with the original contract, the Contractor would be entitled to recover his loss of profit originally allowed for in his tender/contract from that portion of the works being omitted as damages for such breach
	- Even if the omitted works are let to a third party after the original contract period, if the extent of the work omitted relative to the extent or the nature of the whole of the Works shall be such that any rates of the remaining works are rendered unreasonable, then the Contractor shall be entitled to re-rating of the remaining works, unless expressly stated otherwise.
	- Bonus point
		- Invite the Architect to revisit instruction
		- Point out the contractual rights, and address the possible drawbacks to the project of arranging another tender
		- An offer to complete the fitting out work with an accelerated programme and a negotiation on the expenses
- C
	- How can PFSES help the industry
		- To remove site safety from the realm of competitive bidding. Traditionally site safety obligations are governed by law, and such obligations are transferred to contractors through the all-embracing Preliminaries. Contractors when faced with vigorous bidding competition often do not provide adequate site safety provisions
		- To enable any sums payable for carrying out safety measures to be identified in the contract
		- The payment scheme enables proper safety performance to be separately paid for by the Employers, and likewise the contract sum will be adjusted for any failure or non-conformance
		- To provide a mechanism such that site safety could be quantified assessed and paid for under the provisions of contracts. Before implementing the PFSES, it was difficult to identify any monies spent by contractors in carrying out site safety measures; therefore it was difficult to evaluate any failure to perform this obligation
		- To recognize the importance of site safety in construction industry as a whole, in which Employers and Contractors should all participate in fulfilling safety obligations through a payment scheme
	- How PFSES could be incorporated in contract
		- Schedule of safety items with pre-priced unit rates and provisional quantities. The quantities for each of the safety items are determined by remeasurement as the work proceeds
		- The total value of the pre-priced schedule of site safety items should represent approximately 2% of the estimated contract value excluding any contingency or any sum for payment of fluctuations. For contracts with a large portion of the value in the cost of the equipment, the cost of the equipment should be excluded.
		- SCC describing the key components of safety management
		- Particular Specification describing what and how safety measures are to be implemented. Lists of safety regulations and enactments are also given to provide reference to the contractors.
		- Suitable preambles describing how payment for safety measures will be valued based on the schedule of fully specified safety activities / items, provided that specified activities are satisfactorily performed
		- Provisional Sums to be allowed for any promotional campaigns on safety which are territory-wide, which will be expended upon an Architect's Instruction
	- Identify elements under PFSES included in contract
		- Completion of Safety Plan
		- Updating of Safety Plan
		- Provide Risk Assessment
		- Provide Safety Officer
		- Carry out Safety Audit
		- Establish Site Safety Management Committee
		- Attend Site Safety Committee
		- Arrange and attend weekly safety walk
		- Provide safety training

## Question

(total 25 marks)

- **BACKGROUND INFORMATION**
	You are a quantity surveyor working in a Main Contractor’s firm, Modern Construction Co., Ltd. You were appointed as your company’s Project Quantity Surveyor for a residential development project at Yuen Long. The development comprises a 30-storey residential building constructed on top of a 2-storey podium together with a backyard external area on the ground floor. Your company took possession of the Site on 2nd May 2006.

## Question

(total 25 marks)

- **Part 1.1 - Cost Plan**
	Your Company is the Consultant QS for the Bright Star Hotel owned by Lands Company Limited (“LCL”). The project is presently at detailed design stage and LCL’s Project Director commented during the Committee Meeting today that he considered the construction costs for the Hotel, based on Cost Plan No.1 (prepared by your predecessor who has now left your Company and set out in Attachment I below), were high when compared with similar hotels.
	
	Having reviewed the design with the Architect and Engineer, it is considered technically feasible to relocate the carpark from the basement to the podium and this could meet the objective of reducing the construction costs.
	
	The Architect confirmed that the Building would still be within the maximum allowable height limit and the podium height limit even if a one-storey car park is added to the podium. Although it is technically feasible to implement the above change, LCL’s Project Director is keen to understand the full financial implications of the change before making any decision.
	
	1.1.1 In response to the Project Director’s request, your Senior Associate has asked you to update the Cost Plan incorporating the proposed cost saving option, with short notes to explain the logic of your adjustments. (6 marks)
	
	1.1.2 Following comments from his in-house QS, the Project Director would also like you to check and identify any anomalies in the “Structural Frame” element of the Tower in the Cost Plan which may have given rise to the exceptionally high cost of the Tower structure. (6 marks)
	
	1.1.3 Your Senior Associate requests you to draft a reply together with an updated Cost Plan in response to the queries under (1.1.1) and (1.1.2) above including making all necessary adjustments to rectify the anomalies (if any).
	
	Your reply should also highlight any implications associated with the proposed cost saving options if implemented. (6 marks)

- **Part 1.2 - Tendering**
	You are the consultant Quantity Surveyor for a private office development project. Demolition of the existing building is currently in progress on the site and is anticipated to be completed in 6 months time. However there is a possibility that the completion will be delayed.
	
	The Employer wants to commence foundation works as soon as the demolition is completed and to obtain the contractor’s input in the design of the substructure works because the Site has very difficult ground conditions.
	
	The consultant team has discussed the issue and has recommended a “design and build” contract to the Employer. The Architect has requested a meeting to discuss the way forward and the programme.
	
	Please prepare the following information for discussion at the meeting:
	
	1.2.1 A simple bar chart programme identifying the latest date for inviting foundation works tenders taking into account the following: 
	- The successful Contractor will require at least three weeks to prepare and submit a design for the Engineer’s review after the award of the Contract. 
	- The Engineer will require one week to review the Contractor’s submission. 
	- Statutory approval and consent will require three months.	(4 marks)
	
	1.2.2 Prepare a suitable statement in the Preliminaries Bill to address the contract commencement provision in the Design and Construct Contract based on the 1999 Version of the Standard Form of Building Contract (Private Edition). Advice should also be provided of any difference in such provision if the 2005 Version of the Standard Form of Building Contract (Private Edition) was to be used. (3 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- 1.1
	- (1)
		- Item 2.1
			- The diaphragm wall construction with associated ELS and excavation should be deleted
		- Item 2.2
			- The structures, architectural, finishing and M&E installations for a basement car park are similar to a podium car park, except for the facades and elevations
			- The allowances for these items could be adopted and transferred to the podium section
			- Bonus point
				- The space constraint of the podium as the floor plate for the podium is too small to accommodate car ramps / turning points; and an allowance is made for providing a car lift
				- The omission of smoke extraction system as the carpark is now in the podium with louvres to open air
				- The revision of 4 hours FRP partitioning to 2 hours FRP
				- The omission of separate staircases to basement due to revision of MOE
				- Increase in lifts costs to Tower due to increase of one floor in the podium
			- Item 3.2
				- RC facade walls with similar finishes to the podium should be allowed for 
				- Allowance should be made for louvres at car park floor
				- Approx. Facade walls area should be calculating using the girth of the podium floor plate multiplied by 3.5 to 4m high
	- (2)
		- Item 4.1.1(b)
			- The rebar factor at 195 kg/m2 CFA, which is equivalent to 650 kg/m3 of concrete volume, is considered unreasonably high.
			- A more reasonable factor would be around 90-135 kg/m2 CFA (or 300-450 kg/m3 of concrete)
		- Item 4.1.1(c)
			- The reinforced concrete volume for the transfer plate is excessive. Using the Tower footprint area of 720 m2 and a typical 3 to 3.5 m high plate, the RC volume should be around 2200 - 2600 m3.
		- Item 6
			- As the design is already at its detailed deisign stage, an allowance for design contingencies based on 20% of the construction cost is considered as unreasonably high
			- A design contingencies allowance in the region of 5-10% would be acceptable
			- Bonus mark for risk analysis
	- (3)
		- Design implications
			- As the project is currently at detailed design stage, changing the car park location constitutes a major change. Substantial re-design and co-ordination with different design disciplines will be necessary. This will involve a revised BD submission which will have time implications.
		- Programme implications
			- It would generally be expected to see a reduction in overall project duration due to eliminating the basement carpark, because the time required to construct the diaphragm walls and the two storey basement is far longer than the time required to construct an extra podium floor
			- The elimination of the basement means that once the foundations are completed, the podium works could be commenced immediately. Hence the superstructure works could be commenced earlier than in the case where the basement is included
			- Eliminating the basement car park will also eliminate the risks associated with the ground conditions
		- Procurement implications
			- In the original scheme, it would generally be expected to start the diaphragm wall / basement construction in advance of the superstructure works, leaving more time for the design team to complete the detailed design of the superstructure works. However, with the proposed option, as soon as the foundations are completed, the construction of the superstructure works could commence. This means that the construction of the car park in the podium could be included as part of the overall construction and the design of the superstructure works may need to be advanced to facilitate earlier tendering.
	- Candidates are expected to provide
		- A letter stating the objective of this exercise
		- The letter should summarise
			- The amount of cost savings related to the elimination of the basement carpark and relocating the same to the podium
			- The finding of  / adjustment made to correct the anomalies
			- The implications if the proposed design change is to be adopted
			- Reconciliation between the revised and previous cost plans
			- Conclusion of the exercise
		- An updated cost plan
- 1.2
	- (1)
		- The latest date for inviting tenders should be presented in a bar chart which can be copied and circulated for discussion at the meeting. The bar chart should show the following key activities:
			- Preparation of tender doc
			- Tender period
			- Tender evaluation and award
			- Anticipated date of commencement
			- Contractor's submission of design for Engineer's approval
			- Engineer's review of the Contractor's design
			- Allowance for amendments to take into account Engineer's comments
			- BD approval and consent
			- Anticipated date for possession of site
		- The overall duration should not exceed 6 months to meet the Employer's requirement to commence foundation works as soon as the demolition work is completed. The possible delay i the demolition work should not be factored into the planning at this stage.
	- (2)
		- The meeting that a Date of Commencement needs to be added to the contract by the means of SCC to detach the possession of site from the commencement of the contract, so as to allow the Contractor to commence design before the Date of Possession. Furthermore, to cater for the possibility of delay in the preceding works resulting in the tentative site possession date being deferred, the EOT clause in the contract has to be amended to make such delay in giving possession an excusable item eligible for EOT to avoid a time at large claim. Consideration can be given to barring any cost claims resulting from such EOT. (based on 1999 SFBC)
		- New 2005 SFBC provides for both Date of Commencement and Date for Possession to be inserted into the Contract and provides for EOT to be granted for delay in possession.

## Question

(total 25 marks)

- **Part 2.1 – Procurement**
	The Developer, Lands Company Limited. (“LCL”), has another development, a high-end Boutique Hotel in Mongkok. Your company is the Consultant QS for this project.
	
	The programme for the development requires an Advance Works Contract to be let which comprises the following works.
	
	(1) Site formation excavation works to form platforms within the Site for the future building development. (2) Construction of a box culvert for the surface water drainage system.
	
	In previous project meetings, it has been decided that the Contract will be a lump sum fixed priced Contract based on Bills of Quantities.
	
	You have commenced preparation of the tender documents for the Advanced Works Contract and received the following information from the Engineer:
	
	2.1.1 The Engineer has prepared a preliminary design for the lateral support system for the site formation excavation using sheet piling and steel shoring. However to allow the Contractor the opportunity to propose more economical alternatives, his specification requires the Contractor to take responsibility for the design and obtain statutory approval of the lateral support system for the site formation excavation. The Employer would wish to have the market prices of the Engineer’s design and the Contractor’s design available to him before he makes the decision to award the contract.
	
	Draft a letter to the Employer to advise him on the appropriate tendering arrangement so that the Engineer’s design and the Contractor’s proposal for the lateral support system for the site formation excavation can be compared from both a time and cost point of view. In your letter you should draw up a list of issues which should be addressed in the tender documentation to deal with the Engineer’s information and also your proposed tendering arrangement. (8 marks)

	2.1.2 The Engineer has advised that the width and bottom level of the box culverts cannot be finalised in time for the tender and those shown on his drawings are only indicative. Also, he has shown on the drawings a temporary cut slope of 45 degrees for the open cut excavation for the box culverts and has stipulated in his particular specification that this profile must be followed by the Contractor.
	
	You are using the Third Edition of the Standard Method of Measurement for Building Works for this Contract and your office standard Preambles contain the following clauses:
	
	A) Allowance for working space has been made in accordance with the SMM principles to excavations for all reinforced concrete members where formwork is required.  
	B) The rate for excavation shall include for planking and strutting, temporary shoring and any means of securing and maintaining the faces of excavation and for any extra excavation and backfilling necessary therefor.
	
	Please advise your BQ team members on how the excavation for the box culverts is to be measured in the Bills of Quantities so as to facilitate valuation of future variations when the sizes and bottom levels are finalised, and draft suitable special Preamble clauses for their guidance. (5 marks)

- **Part 2.2 - Prefabrication / In-situ Construction**
	Due to programme constraints, part of the preliminary design of the high-end Boutique Hotel Project mentioned in Part 2.1 is already underway. The Project Director of LCL envisages that it would be quite some time before LCL is able to finalize the deal with the potential Hotel Operator who may have different views on the internal layout of the Hotel.
	
	The Project Director seeks your views on the viability of using prefabrication or in-situ construction for this Project.
	
	Please prepare a memorandum highlighting the key issues and any benefits associated with the two forms of construction. The key issues should cover the following perspectives:
	- Planning and Design  
	- Programming  
	- Financial  
	- Construction  
	- Other issues
	
	(12 marks)
	
	The following Project information and an indicative site plan (attached) are given for reference.

## Assessor Notes

- 2.1
	- (1)
		- Not only will there be differences in cost for the Engineer's design and the Contractor's design, but there will also be time differences in the completion of the works due to the possible extra time for design submission, approval, statutory submission and approval by the statutory authorities
		- The design responsibility in the two arrangements should be clearly spelt out
		- To facilitate the comparison, two different tenders, in the form of Tender A & B, or alternative tenders, can be arranged
		- To capture the full time and cost aspects of the Contractor's option for comparison purposes, the time for completion for the Contractor's design option tender should be left for tenderers to fill in
		- The method of comparing different time periods for the works in the two arrangement
		- Special clause in the Instruction to Tenderers should stipulate the requirement for the Tenderer to submit both a base tender based on the Engineer's design and an alternative tender for the Contractor's design with both cost and time for comparison with the base tender
		- Preliminaries clauses should be added to specify the design responsibility and the responsibility for obtaining statutory approval for the lateral support work. The clause should specify that the Contractor shall take over the design responsibility even though he adopts the Engineer's design.
		- Special preamble clauses in the BQ to specify how Engineer's design is incorporated into the BQ
		- Special preambles clauses in the BQ to specify that what back up pricing information is to be submitted for the Contractor's alternative design to allow a detailed evaluation of the alternative price
	- (2)
		- (a) Follow the Engineer's suggested 45 degree cut slope and draft special preambles clauses to specify the excavation is measured in accordance with the profile shown on the drawings and state the departure from the SMM for working space allowance.
		- (b) Follow SMM and the office standard preambles and draft special preambles clauses to require the Contractor to allow for any additional cost in the rates
		- (a) is the preferred method as it provides better unit rates for valuing the re-measurement
- 2.2
	- Characteristics of this development
		- Possible change to the layout
		- Non-typical storey heights related to the podium and top floors of the tower
		- Little repetition in guestroom layouts
		- Programme constraints
		- Site constraints
	- Building elements using pre-cast / prefabrication construction
		- Precast facade
		- Precast slab, beam
		- Precast internal walls and partitions
		- Precast staircases
		- Prefabricated bathrooms
		- Prefabricated pipe ducts
	- Planning and design consideration
		- There should be adequate number of repetitive units to justify for the use of precast elements
		- Inflexibility in design as precast construction requires leas-time for statutory submission, approval and consent, shop drawings approval, manufacture and delivery
		- Once the precast operation is underway, changes in layout may involve substantial abortive work - which could be costly and detrimental to the programme
		- Design decisions have to be advanced to avoid abortive work. Activities like selection of sanitary fittings, co-ordination related to furniture / fixtures, etc. That take place after commencement of construction but much later in the programme in traditional construction would have to be advanced.
	- Programme consideration - overall precast less time
		- Extended construction time required in construction due to vertical transportation; also depends on the size of each panel, lifting capacity of the hoists, cranes available
		- Concrete cycle could be extended
		- Time required for going through the learning curve
		- Statutory submission for design approvals and consents for construction required in advance
	- Cost consideration
		- There should be adequate number of repetitive units to justify cost effectiveness - such that factory equipment, moulds, standard detailing, etc. Could be utilized to its full capacity
		- Likely changes to the design requirements e.g. layout, types of finishes, sanitary fittings, etc will have higher impact on prefabrication costs than traditional construction
		- Higher premium in providing site facilities e.g. hoists, cranes, delivery cost, etc.
	- Technical consideration
		- From the logistic and site planning perspective, precast construction requires a large amount of working space on site for unloading, hoisting, storage, maneuvering 機動 of the unit
		- If the site is located along busy roads, the delivery and hoisting of the precast units may only be possible during the night, hence increasing the cost
		- Site constraints should be taken into account in the site planning
		- Finishes could be integrated into the precast panel during factory production - reduces the amount of wet trades on site
		- Consideration given to expensive materials to be precast as this would increase the weight of the panels and making lifting operation difficult; or may involve higher risk in breakage during transportation
		- Enhance quality control in factory production
		- Difficult to achieve weathertightness. Due consideration should be given to joint details between precast units - once constructed, it will be difficult to rectify
	- Other consideration
		- Precast construction provides GFA exemption for high rise development - there could be a substantial gain in floor area
		- Green construction - help to enhance the corporate image of the developer

## Question

(total 25 marks)

- **Part 3.1 – Extension of Time**
	Note to Candidates
	
	You are to assume either the role of a Quantity Surveyor working in a consulting quantity surveying firm or in a contractor firm and state which one you have chosen in your answer. You should also base your answer to this question on the Standard Form of Building Contract (Private Edition) 1999 Version with clause 23 un-amended.
	
	Background Information on the Project
	
	The project is a private residential development in North Point on Hong Kong Island. The project is now in the construction stage and is near the statutory Occupation Permit (OP) inspection scheduled to be held next week. Apparently there is delay in the completion of the Works which was originally scheduled for 27 September 2007.

- **3.1.1**
	The Employer recalled that due to the recent upsurge of copper prices in the international market, he had previously entered into a supplemental agreement with the Main Contractor whereby the Employer would purchase the copper cables for incorporation into the project in order to resolve the Main Contractor’s cashflow difficulties. These cables formed part of the original Main Contract between the Employer and the Main Contractor.
	
	However, delivery of the copper cables from the manufacturing plant in Nanjing had been delayed by approximately 1 month due to the fact that the transport routes had been damaged (both railway and domestic highways) by the recent unprecedented severe rainfall experienced in Nanjing and Suzhou, PRC.
	
	Please discuss if the Main Contractor would be entitled to an extension of time in the above circumstances, and under the following two different scenarios in the supplemental agreement:
	
	(a) The liability lies with the Employer for delivery of the cables.  
	(b) The liability lies with the Main Contractor for delivery of the cables.

- **3.1.2** 
	The Clerk of Works reported that after the cables had been delivered to site, there were 20 days of bad weather which caused the suspension of the laying of the cables outdoors and the subsequent refilling of the cable trenches along the EVA of the building which was originally scheduled to take place in the first three weeks of September 2007. The Clerk of Works report on the bad weather is as set out below:
	![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805111819.png)
	
	Please give your contractual advice to your boss on possible extensions of time under these circumstances, with justification, and your estimate of the likely extension of time that could be granted to the Main Contractor. (7 marks)

- **Part 3.2 – Payment Valuation**
	You are a quantity surveyor working in a consultant QS firm. You are appointed as your company’s Project Quantity Surveyor for a high rise office development. The development comprises a 25-storey office building (i.e. G/F entrance with plant rooms and 24-storey typical floors). As of today, the typical floors have been concreted up to and including the 15th floor slab. During yesterday’s site meeting, the Contractor complained that the materials on site and work done for reinforcement (all measured as PROVISIONAL in the Bills of Quantities) were substantially under-assessed by your company in the last payment.
	
	The site visit for payment assessment is scheduled for next Tuesday. The Resident Engineer and the Contractor have advised you that there is no off-site bar bending for this project. You are asked by your company’s Associate Director to write him a memo to advise the following :-
	
	3.2.1 The relevant clause(s) of Conditions of Contract relating to interim payment (other than calculation of retention) for reinforcement for the Works. (2 marks)
	
	3.2.2 Your approach and factors to be considered in reviewing the assessment of (i) the quantity of reinforcement materials on site; and (5 marks) (ii) the quantity of reinforcement work done (PROVISIONAL). 4 marks

## Assessor Notes

- 3.1.1
	- Assume that the delivery of cables is on the critical path of the overall progress of works
	- A. delivery liability on Employer
		- In accordance with GCC, MC should give notice to the Architect stating that the apparent late delivery of the cables will cause a delay in his overall completion of the Works
		- Within the context of the original contract conditions, discuss whether there is any relevant provision entitling MC to EOT for the late delivery causing the delay
	- B. delivery liability on MC
		- The delivery has been delayed due to the unprecedented rainfall and subsequent damage of transport routes 
		- According to un-amended GCC, only inclement weather recorded in HK having a delaying effect on the overall progress of Works will be eligible for granting EOT. The unprecedented rainfall in Nanjing and Suzhou therefore will not fall within this interpretation
		- GCC regarding force majeure is a controversial issue. It has been established in a number of precedent court cases that force majeure is generally interpreted as an Act of God or other exceptional matters or events beyond the control of either party to a contract. The damage to the transport routes caused by the unprecedented rainfall, but not the rainfall, could be classified as a force majeure event. 
- 3.1.2
	- The suspension of the works is on the critical path and the delay in the said works has caused a knock-on delay in the overall completion of the Works. 
	- Under GCC, inclement weather with rainfall > 20mm, black rainstorm & typhoon No.8 are listed event for EOT.
	- Subsequent effects of the above bad weather should also be taken into consideration in granting EOT, e.g. likely subsequent works for making good and reinstatement
	- Possible day & extended completion date; consider Sunday no noisy works
- 3.2.1
	- Clause 32.1 - Interim Certificates and interim valuations
	- Clause 32.3 - Estimate of amount due in Interim Certificate, including work and materials delivered
	- Clause 32.3 - Off-site materials or goods
	- Clause 38.1 - Fluctuation provision
- 3.2.1
	- Assessment of MOS
		- Check delivery notes as a reference for calculating the total qty of reinforcement delivered
		- The qty of reinforcement as MOS shall be calculated as the total qty of delivered reinforcement minus the total qty of the items considered below:
			- Estimated reinforcement installed
			- Wastage
			- Any premature delivery of reinforcement
			- Check against the preambles to omit any items which are not measurable under the Contract
			- Check with SE / COW to see if any additional reinforcement has been used by Contractor to suit the site works which are not measurable under the Contract
			- Check with SE / COW for any verbal instructions for reinforcement works not yet covered by AI
			- Check with SE / COW for abortive works due to variations / Contractor's own fault, e.g. rejected works
			- Check with SE / COW for any unauthorized removal of delivered materials
		- Assessment of works done of pro qty
			- Assess with practical approach
			- Seek advice from SE about the designed steel ratio for structural elements
			- Obtain steel ratio from similar projects for reference
			- Estimate the qty of reinforcement for major elements in the typical floors by measuring the reinforcement of a selected typical floor from the latest drawings
			- Estimate qty of reinforcement for other elements (such as non-structural walls) on the typical floors by measuring the reinforcement of a small portion of those elements from the latest drawings so as to obtain relevant steel ratios
			- Check and compare the re-measurement of reinforcement submitted by the Contractor
			- Adjust any fluctuations in the cost of labour and materials for reinforcement works in accordance with Contract

## Question

- **Part 4.1 – Cash Flow**
	4.1.1 “Contractors most of the time face a cash flow catch-up game in a construction contract.” Your newly appointed Finance Director asks you, the in-house QS of a building contracting company, to give your views on this statement and to explain to her the underlying reasons for the above comments from the perspectives of the building contract provisions and a contractor’s cash outlay pattern. The Finance Director also mentioned that while she understands cash flow risks could be transferred to sub-contractors, the same should be ignored in your comments to give a meaningful account. (3 marks)
	
	4.1.2 She also asked you to propose amendment(s) to the existing payment mechanism/mode in the standard private form of building contract with a view to improving the situation. (2 marks)

- **Part 4.2 – Valuation of Variations and rate build-up**
	During the progress of the Works, the depth of some manholes was increased as per Architect’s Instructions. As a result, part of the trench excavation for drain pipes was also increased up to an average depth of 2.25m (instead of the original maximum depth of not exceeding 1.50m total depth).
	
	It was noted that there was no change of soil condition during the trench excavation for drain pipes not exceeding 1.50m total depth. However, during the trench excavation for drain pipes at average depths of 2.00m and 2.25m, a large quantity of rock was encountered as recorded and verified by the Resident Engineer. The site records of soil conditions at different depths agreed between the Resident Engineer and the Contractor are as follows: -
	
	![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805111834.png)
	
	This is a lump sum (with quantities) Contract. The Preambles to the Contract Bills provide, inter alia, that: -
		“DR1 The Contractor is directed to visit the Site and inspect such trial holes as may exist and satisfy himself as to the nature of the Site and the ground to be excavated prior to tendering.”
		“DR2 The rates for trench excavation shall include for :-
		(i) Excavating in level or sloping ground and in any type of ground whatsoever encountered, including boulders and solid rock, and for deploying the use of compressed air plant, wedges or other plant and appliances if required.  
		(ii) Planking, strutting and/or shoring to all faces of excavation including any additional excavation and backfilling occasioned thereby.”
	
	Based on the above Preambles Clauses and the attached Bills of Quantities for trench excavation for all drain pipes (i.e. B.Q. page DR/4), the Consultant Quantity Surveyor advised that the assessed new rates for trench excavation for drain pipes not exceeding 200mm diameter; 1.50−3.00m total depth; are as follows: -
	- 1.75 m average depth $280/m
	- 2.00 m average depth $310/m
	- 2.25 m average depth $340/m
	
	Your boss protests that he will lose money on these new items if he agrees to the Consultant Quantity Surveyor’s valuation assessment. You are requested by your boss to look into the matter to give your view as to whether the said assessed rates are correct and, if not, work out what the fair rate(s) should be.
	
	Please draft a memo to your boss setting out your views and the correct approach in assessing new rate(s), if any. Your memo shall include the reasons in support of your views. (10 marks)

- **Part 4.3 – Insurances**
	The Architect informed your office yesterday of two incidents which happened on site in an office redevelopment project, for which your firm is the Consultant QS.
	
	4.3.1) a reported case of the Electrical NSC’s electrical cables being stolen after they were delivered to site.  
	
	4.3.2) a reported accident in which certain window frames, belonging to the Window NSC, had fallen off the cradle when being hoisted to upper levels for installation, damaging the temporary latrines set up on site plus a portion of the covered walkway in the neighbouring property. Luckily, no person was injured.
	
	Your Director-in-charge has asked you to prepare a short report to the Employer to explain the respective responsibilities of the parties (the Employer, the Main Contractor and the Sub-Contractors) for each of the above incidents under and outside contract, and which and what insurance policies called for under the Main Contract and Nominated Sub-contracts are relevant to address them. Your report should also quote the respective relevant conditions in the Main Contract and the Sub-contract to elaborate.
	
	(10 marks – 4 marks for incident in 4.3.1, and 6 marks for 4.3.2)

## Assessor Notes

- 4.1.1 Reason
	- There is difference between a contractor's cash-in mode, which is wholly dictated by the provisions of the building contract, and the cash-outlay mode which is based on the contractor's own arrangements with suppliers and tradesmen to facilitate the carrying out of the works in a timely and financially efficient manner.
	- Reasons for differences
		- In most building contract terms and conditions, considerations of the amount payable to contractors resolve around whether such amount represents the value to the Employer. From this imperative, only "works properly executed and materials and goods delivered to or adjacent to the Works" are payable under the contract. Contractor's cash outlay, however, does not necessarily match this intention and this creates a time lag between costs spent and money received. 
		- Flowing from the above, materials ordered for the contract works will only be eligible for payment if they are delivered to site and not too prematurely delivered. Material supply payment terms from the suppliers and their delivery programmes do not, however, necessarily match that of the site progress, particularly where materials are imported, bulk purchased or ordered.
		- Contractor's hedging of rising material costs through early engagement of material supply contracts will result in early cash outlay in the form of deposits, LCs etc being required.  Recovery of these early committed costs is usually out of sequence with the contract payment schedule.
		- The valuation time, certification period and the payment period in building contracts also contribute to the time lag.
		- Retention under the contract contributes to the difference, especially during the early stage of the contract when the maximum retention amount has not been attained yet.
		- For variations to contracts with additional cost effect, the PQS usually takes a conservative valuation attitude to avoid overpayment. The situation will also be exacerbated by the insufficient time to properly conduct valuations of variations. 
		- Contractor's pricing strategy during tendering also contributes to the situation. Where early completed works items have been underpriced, a contractor could only rely on the completion of better priced subsequent work items to recoup the negative cash flow.
		- While the actual costs for securing bond / insurance amounts are usually recoverable by presenting the actual payment receipt to PQS, the hidden cost for securing a bond, i.e. by the contractor depositing a security to his surety represent another cost to the contractor which is seldom reflected in the tender sum especially with the current competitive bidding climate.
- 4.1.2 Amendment to CC for improvement
	- Period of valuation - fortnightly instead of monthly basis
	- Bond requirement, amount, timing of release to be modified so that the demand for cash security to the contractor can be eased
	- Retention requirement and timing of release
	- Material off site to be made payable - with title reverting to the Employer and goods fully insured
	- Advance payment for material ordering or purchase - to be supported with a security in favour of the Employer
	- Employer to arrange for supply of certain materials, including the direct financing option - the Employer however may require tight control of title issue, liability for delivery timing and wastage issues; also special conditions will be required
- 4.2
	- DR1 directs the Contractor to visit the Site and inspect trail holes as to satisfy the ground to be excavated prior to tendering. DR2 states that the rates for trench excavation shall include for (i) & (ii). These clauses however do not imply that the Contractor is obliged to carry out trench excavation at new depths by adopting pro-rata rates without adjusting the additional cost for excavation at deeper levels
	- Under the Contract, the maximum average depth for trench excavation for drain pipes is 1.50m only. If the depth of trench excavation exceeds the original maximum depth, the Contractor has a good argument that he had no way to price for the trench excavation at the new depths during the tender stage.
	- For trench excavation exceeding 1.50m depth, ELS / planking works or open cut will be required as per statutory requirements. Therefore, star rates shall be applied as the Contractor has not allowed in his BQ rates for such an excavation method at the original depth of excavation.
	- For trench excavation at average depth of 2.00m and 2.25m, there is a substantial change of soil condition according to the agreed site records. Therefore, star rates shall be applied as the Contractor has not allowed in his BQ rates for excavating in rock.
	- Contractor may ask for fair valuation of the extra cost due to additional temporary works and sudden change of soil conditions.
	- When calculating the rate for trench excavation of 1.75m average depth, the consultant QS should take into account the extra cost for ELS / planking works or open cut, and the cost for excavating in rock. The calculation of the star rates should be based on the soil : rock ratio by pro-rating of the original BQ rates for trench excavation for soil and adding a fair market rate for trench excavation for rock.
- 4.3.1
	- MC cl.21, possession of site has been given to MC who is charged with the contractual obligation under cl.1 to take full responsibility for the care of the Works.
	- If it can be established that the MC has failed to take reasonable precautionary steps to secure the site and as a result the theft had eventuated, the MC as the party having possession of the site may be liable to the NSC for the loss flowing from the theft.
	- In practice, plant/materials stolen or missing from the Site are usually excluded from Section I of CAR (depends), unless such loss is identifiable with a specific event (such as a reported break-in to the Site, burglary)
- 4.3.2
	- The injury/damage to the properties arose out of or in the course of or by reason of the carrying out of the Works
	- The damages are 
		- Damage to the window frames delivered to site which is the property of the NSC / Employer
		- Damage to the temporary latrines, which is the property of MC
		- Damage to 3rd party property
	- Whether MC is obliged to indemnify the Employer under GCC for any expenses, liability, loss, claim or proceeding arising from the incident (i.e. 3rd party's claim) depends on whether such incident is due to any neglect, omission, or default of the MC or the NSC. If so, then MC shall indemnify the Employer. If it cannot be established that there is neglect, omission or default on the part of the MC, then no such indemnity exists.
	- With regards to the respective insurance coverage, Section I of CAR should cover damages to the temporary latrine as well as the window frames. Section II should cover the claim for damages for either party. If the indemnity exists from MC to E, then MC shall be responsible for the excess in CAR. If not, E will have to bear the excess.

## Assessor Notes

- 1.1
	- (1) CFA v GFA
		- In general, GFA is the area measured by QS for the purpose of estimation of the construction costs of a building. Whereas, GFA is the area measured by Architect for the purpose of building submission and is referred to in the plot ratio calculations.
		- CFA generally covers area of a building that are to be constructed and are measured to the outside face of the external walls of the building and includes all lift shafts, stairwells, car park, plant rooms and the like.
		- GFA is the area contained within the outer surface of external walls of a building measured at each floor level. The non-accountable GFA may include:
			- Fore refuge areas
			- Genuine and properly designed pipe ducts with adequate access for inspection and maintenance
			- The projection of curtain wall system from the outer face of the structural element provided that it does not exceed 300mm; the system does not result in any additional floor area and the system does not form part of the structural system of the building
			- Areas occupied solely by M&E equipment e.g. pump rooms, meter rooms, lift shafts and the like
			- Private car parking and loading and unloading areas
		- CFA are usually larger than GFA due to the non-accountable areas.
		- The main difference is due to the extra 4800m2 that has been added to the CFA by incorporating the covered basement carpark but this is not GFA accountable
	- (2) Cost reconciliation
		- The total cost increase between the two estimates that is approx. (+) $668M. Reasons for the cost increase are: -
			- Tender price increase: increase by 53% between Aug 06 and Aug 08. Even if there were no design changes, this would equate to approx. (+) $592M.
			- Basement carpark (in lieu of open carpark) is added which has caused an increase in foundation cost. The cost increase is approx. (+) $43M is built up as follows:-
				- ![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805111950.png)
			- Changing the single glazed to double glazed curtain wall system. The cost increase is (+) $40M.
			- Open carpark is deleted. Assumed no cost effect as the open space is to be covered with pavement.
			- Proportionate increase in Preliminaries due to the increases above, that is 10% x ($43M + $40M) = $8.3M, say $8M
			- Proportionate increase in Contingencies due to the increases above, that is 5% x ($43M + $40M + $8M) = $4.55M, say (+) $5M
		- Total (+) $688M
	- (3) Single blk to two blk
		- Independent transfer plate for each tower
		- Separate roof and upper roof with finishes for each tower
		- Independent sets of lifts, lift shafts and lift machine rooms
		- Less landscape works
		- Independent building maintenance units
		- Independent building services ductworks
		- Independent main plant e.g. chiller plant units and pump sets etc.
		- Independent main entry lobby at podium
		- More facade / elevation areas for two tower blocks than one single tower block
		- Refuge floor is not required for a tower block 18 floors
		- Assuming that the construction of two towers can proceed concurrently, there will be saving in overall construction time, and therefore saving in the time-related preliminaries costs
		- Passenger hoist should not be required for tower block of 18 floors but one more tower crane may be required for two separate tower blocks
		- Site working areas are required for two separate tower blocks design. Offsite bending yard, relocation of site offices and site storage areas may be required
- 1.2
	- The escalation in general inflation as evidenced by Consumer Price Index in Hong Kong and Mainland China has affected prices and wages at large.
	- Steady growth in the local property market and the Hong Kong government's policy of increased expenditure on infrastructure works suggest that contractors are more selective in tendering due to increased workload and they tend to allow for a wider bid margin in their prices.
	- As a result of the increased workload both in Hong Kong and Macau, it has caused an increase in demand for labour resources; and therefore rises in labour and staff salaries and wages generally.
	- The construction boom in Mainland China, Macau and the Middle East also has impacted the prices of construction materials and heavy plant and machineries generally.
	- The steel bar-benders' month-long strike in Aug 07 had impact not only on steel bar-benders' wages but also on other construction workers' wages
	- Most of the building materials are from Mainland China, Europe and other foreign countries. Because of the appreciation in RMB, Euro Dollars and other foreign currencies, as compared with the weaker HK and US Dollars, imported building materials tends to cost more
	- There have also been significant increases in major new material prices internationally, e.g. increase in iron ore prices has caused sharp increase in re-bar and steel prices
	- More stringent control through taxes and duties by means of cancelling some of the tax rebates for export materials, and also imposing additional taxes on some of the export materials, e.g. cement and rebar, by the Chinese Authorities.
	- The Chinese Authorities have also imposed restrictions on, and therefore reduced the export of, some selected materials such as river sand.
	- The increase in oil prices in latter part of 2007 to early 2008 resulted in increase in prices of oil by-products (e.g. vinyl and PVC products) together with increased transportation costs.
- 1.3
	- Lift
		- Long lead time is required to the lift contractor to carry out the following activities:
			- To prepare and submit the lift design to the design team for approval, which includes calculations, shop drawings
			- To carry out design co-ordination with the design consultant with respect to the sizes of lift pit, lift shaft and lift machine room, etc.
			- To submit and obtain approval of lift equipment
			- To manufacture the machinery
			- The time taken for shipment and delivery
		- Lifts are required to be completed in advance of completion of the remaining works and be ready for statutory inspections. Obtaining statutory approvals is a pre-requisite for obtaining the Occupation Permit for commercial building. Therefore, Lift NSC is normally procured earlier than MC.
		- To address the Employer's concern, a Provisional Sum could be inserted in the tender documents of either lift NSC or MC for the lift car interior works.
	- Curtain wall
		- Long lead time is required for the curtain wall contractor to carry out the following activities:
			- To prepare and submit the curtain wall design to the design team for approval, which includes calculations, shop drawings, mock up samples
			- To carry out mock-up tests on the glazing units to satisfy BD requirements
			- To prepare, submit and obtain approval from BD on the curtain wall design
			- To design and supply the embeds / anchorage for the curtain walls to the MC for him when constructing the structure to cast in as an integral part of the structure
			- To carry out design co-ordination with the design consultant with respect to other trades, for example: the external lighting which could be "built-into" the curtain wall units
			- Manufacturing and delivery the units

#LAD #Variation #SA #ContractAdmin 
## Question

- Question No. 2.1 : Liquidated and Ascertained Damages
	Notes to Candidates: Candidates should state the Standard Form of Contract upon which their Answer is based.
	
	Following the issue of the tenders for the Fitting Out Works for the Catering Area, and in a casual discussion, the Employer told you (the Consultant QS) and the Architect that he has heard the deduction of liquidated and ascertained damages (LADs) was a common practice in the construction industry. The Employer said, in order to protect his financial interest in the Project, he would certainly recover the LADs from the Contractor as soon as the Contractor fails to achieve completion on the Contract Completion Date; and he would expect the QS to make such deduction from the valuation of interim payment immediately when the delay occurred. He also assumed that you would make sure the LAD amount deducted would be sufficient to cover his loss including his loss of profit.
	
	The Architect is concerned by this statement from the Employer. He would like you to respond to that statement by means of a letter stating the correct meaning, interpretation and application of LADs under the Standard Conditions of Contract (in un-amended form) you have recommended for this Project. (15 marks)

- Question No. 2.2 : Procurement of Additional Works
	Immediately after the award of the Contract to the Contractor, the Interior Designer of the Project decided to add a feature false ceiling in order to create the desired ambient atmosphere for the catering area. The Architect pointed out that due to the adding of the feature false ceiling, it would be necessary to add a second layer of sprinkler heads within the ceiling void. The Architect stated that there was no fire services installation required in the original scope of work under the Contract. He also reminded that according to the tenancy agreement issued by the Landlord of the existing premises to the Employer, all modification work to the existing fire services installation must be carried out by the Fire Services (FS) Maintenance Contractor, who is under a term contract with the Management Office of the existing premises.
	
	Your Boss asked you to propose two options on how to procure this additional work contractually; you should state the time and cost implications related to each of the options and state your recommendation for his consideration. (10 marks)

- Notes to Candidates:
	- a. Questions No. 2.3 to 2.4 relates to a lump sum (with quantities) contract for a residential development, which comprises a club house. 
	- b. Candidates should state whether their role is a Consultant QS or a Contractor’s QS when answering Question No. 2.3 to 2.4.

- **Question No. 2.3 – Valuation of Variation**
	Soon after the Works commenced, the Employer decided to change the floor finishes of the Reception and Sitting Areas at the Club House from 600×300×10mm homogeneous tiles to 600 x 300 x 20mm “Crema Deluxe” marble slabs.
	
	You have checked from the drawings that the overall thickness of both the tile and marble finishes is 50mm. You have also checked that the quantities of the B.Q. items measured in the Contract Bills for the floor finishes of the Reception and Sitting Areas at the Club House are correct.
	
	You have obtained the following material cost information from a local supplier:-
	
	![[Pasted image 20250402093723.png]]
	
	A copy of the relevant Preambles clauses related to “All Trades” and “Plasterer” trade and the relevant Bill items is appended in Appendices ‘A’ and ‘B’ respectively for information.
	
	The Architect called you this morning and asked you to prepare a cost estimate of this potential variation. Please prepare your valuation of the potential variation and give notes to illustrate the principles of valuation for the Employer’s consideration, to be discussed in tomorrow ad hoc meeting. (10 marks)

- **Question No. 2.4 – Late Instruction & Works after Contract Completion**
	The Architect advised that the Project is scheduled to have its Fire Services inspection in a month’s time; and Practical Completion / Substantial Completion of the Project will be achieved within two months from now.
	
	During the meeting yesterday, the following potential variation works were discussed:-
	
	The Architect informed that some additional exit signs would be added due to the recent changes in the architectural layouts. (Note: The Contractor has advised that local stock of the exit signs is available and the installation would not take more than one week.) The Employer confirmed changing the wall finishes at all Lift Lobbies of Typical Floors from texture spray paint to a selected type of wallpaper of European origin. (Note: the delivery time of the selected wallpaper is approximately 2 months upon placing of order; and another month for the completion of the replacement work.)
	
	The Employer has considerable concern as to the time and cost implications for implementing these two variations at this stage of the Project.
	
	a. The Employer’s Project Manager seeks your advice on the feasibility of carrying out the two proposed variations after Practical Completion / Substantial Completion is achieved. (5 marks)
	
	b. The Employer’s Project Manager also seeks your advice on the following arrangements in getting the original Contractor to carry out the wallpaper work at all Lift Lobbies of Typical Floors, either by:

	Please write him a letter stating the considerations in relation to time and cost implications of these two arrangements. (10 marks)

## Assessor Notes

- 2.1
	- Identify the statement
		- Recovery of LAD immediately when the Contractor fails to achieve completion on the Contract Completion Date
		- Requesting QS to make deduction of LAD from the progress payment immediately following the delay
		- LAD amount deducted would be sufficient to cover Employer's loss including his loss of profit
	- Generally
		- The general rule is that Contractor is bound to complete the Works by the Date for Completion stated in the Contract or the extended Date for Completion as granted by the Architect according to the Contract. If he fails to do so, he will be liable for LAD to the Employer provided there is a liquidated damages clause in the Contract.
		- To be enforceable, LAD must be a genuine pre-estimate of the expected loss or damage to the Employer as a result of a delay in completion and it must not be in the nature of a penalty. Any unreasonable amount would be construed as a penalty and thus unenforceable in courts. In which case, only un-liquidated damages can be applied based on actual loss. 
		- Components in LAD calculation include items like: direct cost to the Employer, for example: the extra rental costs incurred in providing alternative space so as to maintain the Employer's business operation; the cost of statutory payments like government rent or rates; the extra cost due to the extended period of employing the site supervision team, etc. Loss of profit is not a legitimate item, as the loss is considered as too remote.
		- Reasons for "liquidating" the damages as compared to "special damages" or "un-liquidated" damages are to void the time and cost of disputes involved in calculating and substantiating the actual loss if delay does occur.
		- Who has the right to impose LAD under the Contract? Depending on the choice of form of contract, deduction of the LAD is at the discretion of the Employer and not the Architect nor the QS. It is generally required in most standard forms of contract that Architects shall certify payment for all Works properly executed under the Contract. Unless express conditions are otherwise stated in the Contract, Architects and QS have no authority to set-off payment for work done against deduction of LAD.
	- Prerequisite conditions before imposing LAD
		- Circumstances upon which LAD can be imposed: Under terms of GCC, when the Contractor fails to complete the works by the Contract completion date, then LAD will be calculated based on the rates as stated in the Contract and the period of delay, all in accordance with the Conditions of the Contract.
		- Pre-requisite conditions:
			- Architect's certification of non-completion of the Works beyond the Contract Completion Date
			- Architect's view of the possible grounds of extending the time for completion or upon review of the Contractor's application for EOT
			- Employer's prior notice
	- Implication of imposing LAD
		- Imposing LAD from progress payment will definitely affect the Contractor's cash flow which in serious cases may warrant suspension of the Works
		- Contractors may challenge and may demand the Architect to further review the EOT entitlement
		- Employers may have to pay interest to the Contractors should LAD be imposed but later released due to granting of a furniture EOT to the Contractor
- 2.2
	- Domestic Sub-Contract
		- The Architect could instruct the Contractor to employ the FS Maintenance Contractor to carry out the additional works as variation by means of an AI under Conditions of Contract.
		- In this arrangement, MC could object to this arrangement as the subject variation works are outside the scope of Works that the MC originally contracted for and he could argue that this additional works are beyond this contemplation at the time of tender and therefore has no obligation to take up this work.
		- Alternatively, if MC agrees to undertake this additional work, MC shall also assume to have undertaken the responsibility for both quality and the timely completion of the additional works, albeit that the works are to be carried out by the FS Maintenance Contractor. It would be prudent for the MC to obtain prior agreement with Employer, Architect and FS Maintenance Contractor with regards to the time and cost implications related to this variation work.
		- As the completion of the fire sprinkler services would be required for FSD inspection, it is not unreasonable to deduce that the works fall on the critical path. MC may be entitled to EOT due to this variation work. However, once MC commits to undertake this work, any delay in completion by the FS Maintenance Contractor shall be the responsibility of MC, unless otherwise due to other reasons given in the Contract that justify an EOT.
		- The valuation of the additional work shall include the cost of the works charged by FS Maintenance Contractor plus a % mark-up by MC for providing general attendance, risk and profit; and the cost for all necessary builder's work in connection with the additional work. When compared with the NSC arrangement, the % mark-up under the DSC arrangement would generally be expected to higher since MC takes up more risk and responsibility.
	- NSC
		- Subject to a mutual agreement between the Employer and MC, the additional work could be procured under NSC. FS Maintenance Contractor would be nominated by the Architect to MC under a set of sub-contract conditions, which could be agreed upon by MC.
		- Under the NSC arrangement, the risks and responsibilities that to be borne by MC shall be less than that of DSC arrangement. Examples including the following:-
			- The conditions of NSC provide a back-to-back coverage to the MC for taking up the employment of the FS Maintenance Contractor. In the case of delay caused by FS Maintenance Contractor, now being the NSC, the NSC shall be responsible for the same amount of LAD imposed by Employer to MC; thus relieving the responsibility from the MC.
			- It may also be considered necessary for the FS Maintenance Contractor to take up the design responsibility related to the sprinkler modification works by providing a Form of Warranty directly to the Employer. From MC's view point, and unlike under the DSC arrangement for which MC is totally responsible contractually, this arrangement shall relieve the MC from being directly responsible for the design of the works undertaken by NSC.
			- FS Maintenance Contractor may prefer this arrangement as he could seek direct payment from the Employer in the event the MC fails to make any payment to him.
	- Direct contract
		- Under this arrangement, Employer will directly employ FS Maintenance Contractor, and the FS Maintenance Contractor shall carry out the works during the currency of MC.
		- The Employer and Architect shall be responsible for FS Maintenance Contractor. The responsibilities generally include:-
			- The on-site coordination between the FS installation and other adjacent trades.
			- The timely completion of the FS installation in order not to affect other trades.
			- The timely completion of the FS installation in order to not to affect any statutory inspection and, therefore, completion of MC 
			- Any disputes over claims and counter-claims between FS Maintenance Contractor and MC and/or other sub-contractors will be handled to Employer and/or Architect.
		- If no express conditions are stipulated in the Conditions of Main Contract, the MC may not allow the FS Maintenance Contractor to enter the site as this may affect his insurance coverage.
		- In case there is any delay to the Works, it may be difficult for the parties to identify the cause of delay, and either MC or FS Maintenance Contractor may use the other party as an excuse for their own delay.
- 2.3
	- The potential variation was decided soon after the Works commenced. Therefore, there should be no abortive works. As such, the valuation should not include valuation of abortive materials, abortive works, disruption cost and prolongation cost, etc.
	- As tiles are no longer required, relevant BQ 3.7/E and 3.7/C in relation to tiles and associated 30mm screed should be omitted. The corresponding total amount for these works shall be omitted accordingly.
	- Slabs are to be added, Candidates should value the addition amount using rates for similar works measured in the Contract Bills. In this case, slabs in the Contract Bills would be considered as similar works.
	- Preambles states the method of adjusting PC rates for specific materials. The adjustment of PC rates shall be applicable if the variation involves the same kind of materials, which in this case would be tile. Since the proposed variation involves marble slabs for which rates for similar works are available in the Contract Bills, the adjustment of PC rate method for tiles shall therefore not be applicable for this variation. 
	- Adjustment should be made to the rate of the screed for the marble slabs since the overall thickness of the floor finishes shall be kept at the same thickness of 50mm.
	- Bill rates to be used as a basis for valuation of variation shall be 3.7/B and 3.7/D.
	- ![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805112207.png)
- 2.4
	- (a) late instruction
		- Candidates should identify the need to complete the exit signs prior to the FS inspection as they are essential parts of FSD's requirements; whereas the replacement of paint finish by wallpaper is to satisfy the Employer's request and is not a FSD requirement. 
		- The time required for ordering and installing the signs is relatively short. As the FS inspection is scheduled in a month's time, the Contractor should be able to complete the signs before the scheduled inspection. As the signs are an essential part of FSD's requirements, without which FSD will fail the inspection. It is therefore not advisable to defer this variation which would otherwise be detrimental to FSD inspections.
		- As the installation of the wallpaper work is not essential for FS inspection, subject to the agreement between Employer and Contractor, this variation work can be treated as outstanding works and be carried out at a later stage after the completion of the works, providing that the Employer accepts the implications arising therefrom.
	- (b) i. Immediately issue AI
		- If the wallpaper work is to be instructed before Contract Completion, since the delivery of the selected wallpaper will take two months after placing the order and another month for installation, it will certainly delay the completion of the works.
		- On the basis that there has been no other delay to the Contract so far, instructing the wallpaper work now would affect the completion of the works, which would constitute as late instruction and would entitle the Contractor to EOT; and also associated loss and/or expense due to prolonging the Contract period.
		- If the completion of the wallpaper is essential to the Employer's business operations, it would be prudent to advise the Employer to negotiate and obtain the Contractor's prior agreement on both the time and cost implications before proceeding with the work. The implications may include arranging to expedite the delivery of the wallpaper by air-freight or sourcing local stocks, implementing acceleration measures and adding extra labour resources in the installation works, etc.
		- This arrangement will allow the replacement of the wallpaper be completed prior to completion of the whole of the works, and will be less disruptive to Employer after handover of the completed works.
	- (b) ii. Instruct to carry out after completion
		- Unless expressly provide in the Contract, Contractor is not obliged to carry out works after completion. The Architect may issue an instruction before completion but treat the works as outstanding works.
		- Works carried out after completion may adopt market rates in valuing the works, and he is not bound to adopt the contract rates. The valuation of the works shall include re-rating of any supervision works, protection works, temporary works, labour rates, cost for working out of sequence, etc.
		- Although the time required to complete the outstanding works is subject to agreement between the parties, but the Contractor is not bound by the non-completion clauses in the contract. Therefore, the Employer cannot impose LAD on the Contractor in case of a further delay in completing the wallpaper works occurs.
		- If the magnitude of wallpaper work is extensive, the Employer should be advised to enter into SA with Contractor. The SA should cover all contractual implications arising from the implementation of the variation works after completion.
		- The use of SA may, in principle, be a better arrangement. However, quite often the time and effort taken by the parties to prepare and agree the SA will not make this arrangement worthwhile.
		- If the magnitude of the wallpaper work is less extensive, it would be more practical to obtain Contractor's agreement on the time and cost implications before carrying out the works after completion.

## Question

Question No. Q1 – Cost Plan – Cost Savings

Your Director attended a Design Meeting on the East College Hostel Development, which is presently at schematic design stage.

The Geotechnical Engineer advised that the bedrock level of the Site of the Development was only 2m below the site formation level as revealed from the recent site investigation data. He advised that the previously proposed bored pile foundations could be replaced by pad footings. The following indicative information was given:

Type F1 pad footing: 6.00×3.00×2m deep ×50No .  
Type F2 pad footing: 6.00×10.00×2m deep x60No .  
Similar to pile cap construction but with a reinforcement content of approx. 300kg/m3  
No change in the substructure works

During the same meeting, East College advised that, due to the recent financial crisis, its major sponsor would no longer be able to provide sponsorship to the College. The College urged the Design Team to explore possible savings to reduce the construction cost.

Reducing the storey height of each floor from 4.00m to 3.50m was suggested and was in principle accepted by the College.

In addition, the College also suggested reviewing the need to have curtain walls as these were seen as extravagant design. As an option for the College to consider, the Architect proposed changing the curtain walls to window walls with openable panes such that the glass can be cleaned from inside the Building.

Your Director has asked you to work out the cost savings for the three proposed changes and to draft a memo for his reply to the College. The M&E Engineer will advise any savings in relation to the M&E services to the College directly. Due to the urgency of this matter, there is no need to provide any updated Cost Plan but back-up workings should be provided.

## Assessor Notes

- Three proposed changes
	- Replace bored pile foundations with pad footings
	- Reduce the storey height of each floor from 4.00m to 3.50m
	- Option: Change the unitized curtain walls to window walls with openable panes
- Replace bored pile foundations with pad footings
	- The cost of bored pile foundation, pile caps and lateral support system should be deducted
	- The cost for pad footing should be added
	- Since the bedrock level is 2m below the site formation level and the pad footing is at 2.00m deep, it is unlikely that there will be any rock excavation and hence "extra over for rock excavation" will not be applicable to the pad footings.
	- Also as the pad footing is only 2m deep, it would seem reasonable to assume open excavation and that no lateral support system is required.
	- ![image.png|300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805123839.png)
- Reduce the storey height of each floor from 4.00m to 3.50m
	- Reduce the overall loading, which may affect cost for foundation.
	- % reduction in the overall building height should be calculated (-)12.5%
	- The cost of the vertical components should be identified as these components are proportionately reduced. This includes the followings:
		- Columns and structural walls
		- RC walls to facades
		- Curtain wall
		- Metal cladding to facades
		- Block walls and RC non-load bearing walls
		- Plaster and paint finishes - only the internal wall finishes upto full height should be affected
	- The following components should remain as constant irrespective of the overall building height and thus should be excluded from the costs of the vertical components:
		- Parapet wall, plaster and textured coating
		- Window and louvre
		- Window wall at entrance lobby at G/F
		- Toilet cubicle
		- Door
		- Glazed ceramic tile and stone finish to dado height to internal walls
- Option: Change the unitized curtain walls to window walls with openable panes
	- Change of the curtain wall will affect the GFA
	- The cost of the curtain wall based on the reduced height, adjusted by (-)12.5% should be deducted
	- The cost of the window walls is to be added
	- The cost of the gondola should be deducted since the window panes are openable and could be cleaned from the inside of the building
- Memo summarizing the cost saving items
	- The cost saving for each of the three issues
	- The effect of the savings on the overall cost of the development

#Procurement 
## Question

Question No. Q2 – Procurement Options

Land Development Ltd, a developer, has acquired an existing shopping centre and is planning to renovate and turn it into a high-end retail, dining and entertainment hub. It is anticipated that the tenants will still be occupying some of the existing shops and restaurants during the renovation works. Land Development Ltd. Has engaged your company as the Quantity Surveyor.

Land Development Ltd. Envisages that the existing shopping centre will be renovated internally with state-of-the-art interior design and finishes. All of the existing M&E services and plumbing and drainage installation will be removed, replaced and upgraded with new lighting, building management system, audio-visual system and energy conservation facilities incorporated.

In the meeting yesterday, the representative of Land Development Ltd. Emphasized the urgency of the project and would like to commence the Works as soon as possible while allowing the existing tenants to continue their business with minimal disruption. Your Director explained to Land Development Ltd. That the Works, if procured using the traditional lump sum procurement method, would require a lead time in completing the design. This method will not meet the Employer’s objective.

The representative from Land Development Ltd. Said he has heard about the Management Contracting method and the Design and Build method which will both allow an early start on Site and would like your company to advise him on which method is more suitable for the project. He is also concerned about keeping control of the high quality of the project.

Please draft a letter to the Employer introducing how these two procurement arrangements operate and stating their respective pros and cons specific to this project and providing a suitable recommendation.

## Assessor Notes

- Management contracting
	- Management contracting involves the appointment of a Management Contractor through tendering or by negotiation on the basis of a fixed management fee or a percentage fee based on the prime cost of the project
	- The overall programme and the milestone completion dats for each section of the Works will be fixed by the Employer. Based on this information, the Management Contractor will prepare detailed construction programme taking into account the milestone dates of phased commencement and phased completion. The Management Contractor will also provide advice on work logistics and any time related issues
	- In addition, the Management Contractor will be responsible for the provision of the site management and preliminaries items including providing temporary works and facilities for the project and providing buildability advice to the design team
	- The Works are divided into work package taking into account the existence of the tenants, and each work package or trade is then awarded on a competitive basis. The work package contracts are executed between the works contractors and the Management Contractor. The work package is to be agreed with the Management Contractor.
	- This method requires the design of the Works to be further developed by Employer's design consultant and construction phases, the overall lead time will not be as long as the traditional lump sum method
	- Pros
		- The design and construction processes can be overlapped. The renovation works could be split into various works packages and procurement of the works packages can be arranged to match the availability of design and construction sequence. The later shall be arranged to suit the existing tenants' operation. This reduces the duration of the overall planning / design development process and allows the commencement of part of the Works on site without having to complete the whole design before the contractor is appointed. This would suit the Employer's objective.
		- Having the Management Contractor's involvement early in the process allows early contractor's input on programme, buildability and works packaging, which are important in a renovation project. Having the tenants still occupying the premise whilst the renovation works are being carried out, the Management Contractor will assist in programming and sequencing the Works to minimize the disruption caused to the existing tenants and at the same time target to achieve the milestone dates.
		- Any change in the design which may be necessary to suit the condition of the existing building and related structures and systems, etc could be incorporated into the forthcoming work packages while the Works are being proceeded. This allows greater flexibility in the overall planning
		- With the involvement of the contractor early in the process, the Management Contractor could contribute towards evaluating any design an alternative construction methods such that the most optimal and cost effective design, and construction method will be adopted before tenders for the works packages are invited. This reduces the risk of uncertainty associated with working within an existing building while the Employer enjoys the benefit over optimal design and construction methods proposed by the Management Contractor.
		- All work packages are tendered and procured competitively. The Employer has the benefit in receiving competitive prices from the market.
	- Cons
		- As the process of design, tender and construction is over a period of time while the project is being developed and proceeded, the overall cost commitment is not known until the works packages are fully awarded and therefore reduces the cost certainty at the beginning of the project
		- There is less incentive for the Management Contractor to be cost effective as he is usually paid a fixed or percentage fee based on the actual construction cost.
- Design and build
	- D&B arrangement involves the appointment of a single contractor through either tendering or negotiation for delivering the entire project to fulfill the requirements of the Employer including employing the contractor's own design team. This arrangement will require tender documents outlining the Employer's requirements to be prepared by the Employer. These are usually in the form of a design brief, building functional requirements, area requirements, service performance criteria and finishes standard, etc.
	- Tenderers will be required to submit their design and pricing in the form of a Contractor's Proposal for evaluation and subsequent award. The tender process will be longer, when compared with the traditional lump sum arrangement, because of the time required for the tenderers to prepare the bid proposal and time for the Employer to assess and compare the bid proposals.
	- Pros
		- From the Employer's perspective, this approach provides a single point of responsibility and without having to appoint separately design consultants himself to undertake and complete the design.
		- This approach may appear to offer a quick start on site as the detailed design will be undertaken by the D&B contractor; however the design process will be deferred to a later stage after appointment of the D&B contractor.
		- Risks associated with statutory approval of the design in this approach are shifted to the D&B contractor.
		- This approach provides an opportunity to adopt the contractor's specialist or patent design, which may be essential if the Works involve specialised systems
	- Cons
		- This approach requires the Employer to decide exactly what is required before tenders are invited. This could involve premature decisions. Changes in the Employer's requirements and design after contracts are awarded will generally have time and cost implications. For a renovation project involving alteration and addition works to the existing building and existing structures, the detailed requirements may not be realized before tenders are invited.
		- This approach calls for a well defined selection criteria of the proposed design by the Employer in the very early stage of the project. It is sometimes difficult to evaluate and compare the proposed design against the tender criteria and select the most optimal design at tender stage. 
		- D&B contractors tend to place less emphasis on quality of work and selection of materials or equipment but more emphasis on meeting the minimum standard as required under the Contractor. Employers have less control over quality. This could lead to potential loss of quality control in both design and construction.
		- The effect of the tenant operations and constraints on the sequence of the Works will not be known until the design of the Works has been developed, or vice versa. Also for a project of this nature, the constraints imposed by the tenant operations will need to be accommodated within the contractor's programme and sequence of Works, and these will have time and cost implications to the Contract if the D&B arrangement is adopted.
		- It is difficult to quantify the cost of variations as there is no firm pricing basis upon which the contract is awarded nor any pre-agreed rates for variations. For a renovation project with works being undertaken within an existing environment, variations to the design will be inevitable. The D&B approach will no be cost effective in term of cost controlling.
	- Recommendation
		- Management Contracting method
			- If fulfills the requirement of an early start
			- It provides the Employer with more control over the quality of works
			- It provides more flexibility and better cost control for changes which is important as the project involves working inside an existing building
			- It is able to enjoy the benefit of the Management Contractor's input on programme and sequence of works which is important to accommodate constraints due to maintaining the existing tenant operation.
		- Introduction of target cost or guarantee maximum price to obtain a better degree of certainty on price and to overcome the lack of incentive for the Management Contractor to be cost effective.

#MeasurementBilling 
## Question

Question No. Q3 – Provisional Quantities

Under what circumstances are quantities of works to be measured as “provisional” at tender stage? You are to illustrate the types of works by referring to two examples.

## Assessor Notes

- Circumstances
	- When the design of the works had not yet been fully developed by the design team at the time of preparing of tenders. The details of design available are insufficient to measure firm quantities
	- Design changes are anticipated due to uncertain site / ground condition, user's requirements
	- Design alternatives are under consideration by the design team or Employer
	- When there is insufficient time for QS to measure
- Pro qty serve to provide an indication of the scope and nature of works to facilitate tender comparison and will provide a set of contract rates for payment and final account. All pro qty will be subject to re-measurement upon finalization of design.
- Example
	- Site investigation or ground investigation works, which are subject to the actual site / ground condition
	- Piling works, which are normally subject to actual founding levels before the pile lengths can be determined
	- Site formation works, which are normally subject to the actual topographical survey
	- Reinforcing bars, where are subject to detailed structural design
	- Finishing works where Employer wants to have a choice between alternatives
	- Underground drainage works, which are subject to the actual site condition
	- Builder's works in connection with building services installation, which are subject to the finalized combined services drawings
	- External works which are subject to detailed design at a later stage of a project
	- Repairing spalling concrete at existing buildings, the extent of which is to be ascertained after commencement of works

#Defect 
## Question

Question No. Q1 – Rectification of Defects

Notes to Candidates: You are to state the Standard Form of Contract upon which your answer is based.

The foundation works were substantially completed by the previous foundation contractor, Footing Engineering Limited (“FEL”).

One month after the commencement of the superstructure works, latent defects were discovered which require rectification works to be carried out by FEL. Having studied the extent of the rectification works, the Structural Engineer advised the estimated time for rectifying the defects is about 21 days. He also indicated that the completion of the rectification works is critical to the superstructure works.

The Architect called and asked what would be the contractual implications to the superstructure contract if FEL is to return to the Site and carry out the rectification works concurrently with the superstructure works being carried out by the superstructure contractor.

As the consultant Project QS, your Associate has asked you to note down the contractual implications to the superstructure contract before attending the ad-hoc meeting scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. Any relevant contract clauses that you rely upon shall be clearly stated.

	- By reason of delay or disruption caused by a specialist contract as the qualifying event in cl.27.1(2)(i)
	- Provided that MC provides substantiation required by the Contract and fulfills the notice requirements
- Insurance
	- MC needs to notify its insurers for CAR and TPI of the likelihood of the previous FDN returning to the site to rectify the foundation defects, as both of these insurances would not have covered such work or the involved party. Therefore an endorsement needs to be added to the insurance policies to cover such party and works involved. The premium may need to be increased to include the coverage. Such premium cost, if any, will be recoverable under the appropriate clause of the Contract.

## Question

Question No. Q2 – Extension of Time

Notes to Candidates: You are to state the Standard Form of Contract upon which your answer is based.

Your Company, a general contracting company, was awarded a Contract early this year. Your Company originally programmed to commence and complete the site formation works, being a critical activity for the whole of the Contract, during the dry season.

Following commencement of the Works, a period of 60 days of delay was encountered due to late issuance of crucial design information by the Architect, which hindered the progress of the site formation works. It was not until the wet season that your Company was able to progress the site formation works.

Unfortunately when the Works were ready to start, the progress of the Works was adversely affected by several typhoons and heavy rainfalls. According to the record, a cumulative total of 30 days of adverse weather condition and its subsequent effects was encountered which falls within the definition of adverse weather condition under the Contract and entitles the Contractor to an extension of time under the Contract.

Following your submission of the notice for an extension of time and direct loss and/or expense, the Architect wrote to your Company recognizing that there had been no delay for which your Company was responsible concurrent with the period of delay at issue and advised that a total of 90 days of extension of time for completion of the Works would be granted and that he would request the Consultant QS to ascertain the direct loss and/or expense in connection thereto. The Architect, however, expressly stated in this letter that no direct loss and/or expense would be reimbursed to your Company for the delay caused by the adverse weather condition and the subsequent effect.

A. Your Project Manager has asked you to draft a letter to the Architect in response to the Architect’s statement as underlined in the preceding paragraph. [7 marks]  

B. Your Project Manager has also asked you to gather the relevant information related to site management staff costs that would form part of the direct loss and/or expense claim submission. You are to list down the relevant information required to substantiate the site management staff costs. [5 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A. N during E
	- The delay to commencement of site formation works during the initial 60 days was due to an event for which the Employer / Architect is responsible, i.e. late issuance of design information
	- The period of initial delay had a knock-on effect on the timing of the site formation works, which had to be carried out during a period of adverse weather instead of during the dry season as originally programmed by Contractor.
	- It is not unreasonably for the parties to have assumed and contemplated that the site formation works, being a critical activity of the works, would be affected by adverse weather as the works were to be carried out in the open. Any delay caused to the completion of the site formation works would have a direct impact on the completion of the whole of the works.
	- On this premise, it could be said that the cause of delay flows directly from the initial delay for which the Employer is responsible. Hence the causative event of the subsequent 30 days delay was neither due to the adverse weather nor its subsequent effect, but due to the preceding period of delay for which the Employer was responsible.
	- The Architect granted the subsequent 30 days of EOT for completion of the works thus recognizing that the delay caused by the adverse weather condition was also on the critical path.
	- Hence, subject to proper substantiation from the Contractor and provided that the contract provisions in regard to notices of claims and conditions precedent to the Contractor's entitlement to direct loss and expense have been properly complied with, the Contractor should be entitled to be reimbursed for any direct loss and expense proved to have been incurred during the subsequent 30 days delay caused by the adverse weather and its subsequent effect under cl.27.1(g)(l).
- B
	- Evidence of management staff involvement:
		- Site organization chart during the period of delay
		- Attendance records, such as "handkey" records, labour records and the like
		- Site dairies
		- Management dairies
		- Job allocation sheet, etc.
	- Evidence of actual cost incurred:
		- Payrolls
		- Evidence of all monetary benefits enjoyed by the staff involved
		- MPF records
		- Costs of medical schemes
		- ECI or medical insurances, etc.
	- Contractor's proof of endeavour to mitigate the extent of loss by relocating, as far as possible, site staff to other sites and produce the original organization chart to identify the reduction of staff as shown on the actual organization chart / site records.

## Question

Question No. Q3 – Valuation of Variations

Following receipt of two proposed Architect’s Instructions (AI), your Contract Manager of a contractor firm has asked you to prepare the valuation of the corresponding variations for further discussion with the Employer’s QS Consultant. He has asked you to include any explanatory notes illustrating the underlying principles of your valuation. He has also confirmed that there will not be any time implication to the Contract for carrying out these variations. Copies of the Letter of Award (2 pages) and the relevant pages (2 pages) extracted from the Pricing Document are attached for your reference.

- (a) AI No. 105: Floor finishes to the Changing Room
	The internal size of the Changing Room is 10.10m long × 12.06m wide. The Architect confirmed that the floor finishes within the Changing Room, together with the corresponding cost for supply and delivery to the Site, are as follows:
	
	- 300 × 300 × 10mm “Durable” homogeneous floor tiles at HK$ 120/m²
	- 50 × 300 × 10mm “Durable” homogeneous skirting at HK$ 50/m
	
	Your Project Manager confirmed yesterday that there would not be any abortive works due to this variation.
	
	[6 marks]

- (b) AI No. 106: Revised light fitting at external walls
	The Architect instructed the changing of 10 Nos. Type L1 light fittings (as shown on the Contract Drawings) to 8 Nos. Type L2 light fittings.

## Question

Question No. Q4 – Measuring from As-built Drawings and SMM

- Notes to Candidates: 
	Whenever the term “SMM” is used, it shall refer to the Hong Kong Standard Method of Measurement for Building Works, Fourth Edition, 2005.
	
	Copies of the relevant pages of the SMM are available upon request. Candidates are to refer to Pages 125, 126, 153, 154 and 156 to 159 only.

You are the Consultant Quantity Surveyor for this Project. In the final account, the Nominated Fire Services Sub-Contractor has submitted a complete re-measurement of the fire services works based on the prepared as-built drawings that have not been submitted to the Architect for endorsement. The total net additional cost is significantly higher than the estimated final sum that your Company had previously reported to the Employer. On analysis of the submission, it is found that the Nominated Fire Services Sub-Contractor has included a lot of star rates items like:

(a) Bends and tees for the fire sprinkler pipe works; 
(b) The anti-vibration mounting for the fire services pumps; and 
(c) All metal brackets for the pipe works have been enumerated;

The Employer has recalled that the Nominated Fire Services Sub-Contract was a lump sum sub-contract (without quantities) based on drawings and specification. The schedule of rates in the Sub-Contract was prepared in accordance with the SMM and the preambles (both extracted and attached herein). The Employer has also recalled that there were not too many design changes instructed during the contract.

Your Senior Associate has asked you to clarify the issues with the Employer’s Project Manager by drafting a fax and making reference to the SMM and the Preambles for this Sub-Contract. You may make and list down all reasonable and relevant assumptions in your answer.

- Attachment - Extract of Preambles for Fire Services Installation
	Section A – Generally
	
	1. Except where otherwise measured, the quantities given in the Schedule of Rates (SOR) have been measured in accordance with the Hong Kong Standard Method of Measurement for Building Works (Fourth Edition) issued in 2005, published by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors) (hereinafter referred to as "the SMM"). Specific departures from the requirements of the SMM are as stated in these Preambles.
	2. The items in the SOR should be read in conjunction with the Specification clauses and the relevant Preamble clauses.
	3. All materials and workmanship shall, unless otherwise described, be in accordance with the relevant Drawings and Specification. The rates for items in the SOR shall include for the work being executed in accordance with the Drawings and Specification requirements.
	4. All works shall be measured net from the drawings in conjunction with the Specification requirements.
	5. The quantities in the SOR shall be measured from the Drawings listed in the Specification which indicate the design intent, general routing and position of the Fire Services Installation. The quantities of the Fire Services Installation are measured flat from the Drawings and apart from services risers, the measurement does not take into account any additional service runs or fittings required to route locally around structural members, changes in levels to suit the building structure or architectural details or other services or obstacles and these are required to be allowed for by the Sub-Contractor in his rates and prices.
	6. For valuation of variations and provisional items, the quantities of the Fire Services works shall be measured net from the Drawings issued by the Architect from time to time in accordance with the rules as laid out in clause 5 above.
	7. No adjustment will be made to such measured quantities for any actual difference in quantity from that shown on the Drawings arising from the Sub-Contractor’s co-ordination of the works and the measurement errors in the SOR.
	8. No variation whatsoever will be ordered by the Architect in accordance with the Conditions of Sub-Contract as a result of the services runs and components of the Fire Services Installation being required to be rerouted or repositioned from those positions and routes generally indicated on the Drawings unless such revisions in the Architect’s opinion deviate from the design intent of the Drawings. The unit rates and prices for the Fire Services Installation shall be deemed to have allowed for this and be in accordance with the rules as laid out in clause 5 above.
	
	Location of work
	
	9. Notwithstanding clause XVII (a) 1 M.2 of the SMM, work is measured irrespective of location and fixing background. Provision of brackets, hangers as required, together with all necessary bolts, nuts, screws, nails, plugs, fastenings and related holes in components and accessories shall be deemed to be included.
	
	Pipework and ancillaries
	
	10. Rates for tees shall be deemed to include all equal and unequal tees, and in the case of unequal tees and reducing sockets they shall be measured as extra over the largest diameter pipe connections.
	11. Rates for reducers to obtain connections of the correct type and angle shall be deemed to include elbows, tees, junctions, crosses and the like. Notwithstanding clause XVII (d) 2.1 of the SMM, rates for pipework shall include for any alternative method of jointing and fixing as described in the Specification.
	12. Notwithstanding clause XVII (d) 12, 13, 14, 15 of the SMM, rates for pipework shall include for screwed sockets, tappings, bosses and welding-necks welded to pipes or flanges.
## Assessor Notes

- Remeasurement based on as-built dwg
	- As the Sub-Contract is a lump sum contract (without quantities) based on Drawings and Specification, the Sub-Contract Sum should not be adjusted unless varied by the Architect under the expressed provisions as stated in the Conditions of Sub-Contract.
	- The valuation of any variations and the related measurement shall be taken from the Drawings issued by the Architect (in accordance with the provisions in the Preambles attached to the Question) instead of from the as-built drawings prepared by the Sub-Contractor. Unless the as-built drawings were confirmed (but not merely commented or approved) by the Architect as constituting design changes or the Architect has issued Architect's Instructions to endorse the as-built drawings, these drawings should not be used as the basis of measurement for variation works. Bonus marks should be given to those Candidates who are able to explain the difference between design drawings and as-built drawings.
	- Candidates may also state that the Sub-Contractor should refer to Preambles Clauses 4 to 8 when measuring from the Drawings. As this is the basis upon which the contract rates have been calculated, a similar measurement approach should also be adopted when valuing variations using the contract rates. The use of as-built drawings for measurement is not appropriate as the additional service runs or fittings required to route locally around structural members, changes in levels to suit the building structure or architectural details or other services or obstacles usually shown on the as-built drawings should have been allowed for and included in the unit rates for the works.
	- Having said that, if the Architect has confirmed the as-built drawings as constituting design changes, then Clause 6 and 9 of the Preambles should be carefully applied. In simple terms, if (under Clause 6) the additional service runs or fittings required to route locally around structural members, changes in levels to suit the building structure or architectural details or other services or obstacles, OR (under Clause 9) the services runs and components of the FS work required to be rerouted or repositioned from those positions and routes are all indicated on the as-built drawings, these should be measured.
- Star rate items should not have been separately measured as stated in SMM. The cost for these individual items is deemed to have been included as part of the Contract Rates priced in the SOR.
	- According to SMM XVII(D)2C2(a), all bends and tees for pipeworks at 50mm diameter or below area deemed to be included in the rates of pipeworks. Only those for over 50mm diameter shall be measured as "extra over".
	- According to SMM XVII(b)(9)C.1(g), anti-vibration mountings  should not be measured separately, and the cost should be included in the rates for pumps. Unless additional FS pumps are instructed by Architect or such mounting not shown in original dwg & spec, no additional payment.
	- Metal fixing brackets are included in the rates for various measured fire services items in SOR as stated in SMM XVII(a)(1)C.5. There are no specific rules in other parts of SMM for the measurement of brackets for pipework.
- Reply
	- Clarify misunderstanding of rules of measurement by NSC
	- Reason for NSC's inflated final account
	- State correct interpretation & SMM

## Question

Question No. 1 - Cost Plan [15 marks]

A local developer, Harvest Company Limited ("HCL"), is intending to bid for the land on Lot 130 Ho Man Tin Road, which is currently a vacant site, to be auctioned sometime next month. This land is very close to another HCL's development: The STAR Residential Development ("The STAR") which is located on Lot 121 along the same Ho Man Tin Road. The apartments of The STAR were sold very well and HCL intends to lease Lot 130 in the forthcoming auction and develop this Lot to a type and class similar to The STAR.

The site area of Lot 130 is approximately 2,000 m2. The potential plot ratio is the same as that of Lot 121, with no concessionary arrangement in both cases.

This morning, the Financial Director of HCL called you and asked for a rough indication of the current construction cost of the potential development at Lot 130 assuming the development will be similar to The STAR on Lot 121. He would also like to know the current cost per square foot so that he can bench-mark against other developments. As he will be out of the office today, he has asked your company to respond to his enquiries by an email. He has just emailed a copy of the historical cost data of The STAR for your information. Your senior Associate, Ms. Wong, asks you to prepare the rough estimate by using the data of The STAR, but would require you to:

(a) write some notes stating the checks, cautions and adjustments that you would exercise when adopting such data; [Sub-total for item (a): 5 marks]  

(b) do back-up calculations; and [Sub-total for item (b): 5 marks]  

(c) draft a simple cost summary with necessary qualifications for submission to HCL (covering letter not required). [Sub-total for item (c): 5 marks]

## Question

Question No. 2 - Tendering [15 marks]

The Employer, Harvest Company Limited (HCL) , has bought a block of six-storey dilapidated industrial building at 123 AB-Lane at Kwun Tong. HCL intends to renovate the building and turn it into office spaces with the ground floor to be used as retail spaces.

Tender documents for the renovation works were issued two weeks ago. The scope of the Works generally includes upgrading the interior finishes and building services installations. The Contract is to be based on a lump sum fixed price contract with quantities forming part of the Contract. The tender documents provide for a fixed Contract Period of 400 calendar days with a milestone date for obtaining the Occupation Permit (OP) within 340 calendar days.

Two weeks into the four-week tendering period, the Structural Engineer has completed the concrete survey and discovered patches of spalling concrete on the walls and ceilings of every floor. The area of spalling concrete amounts to approximately 1,000m2 . There is no provision for rectification of spalling concrete in the currently issued tender documents. The Structural Engineer has advised that the rectification work will cause 40 days delay to the originally scheduled overall works programme.

In the mean time, HCL is about to close a deal with a chain-store company, SuperMart, which intends to rent the ground floor as a supermarket. However, SuperMart wants to have the ground floor handed over to them ready for their in-house specialist contractor to carry out fitting out work at least one month in advance of the completion of the works of the whole building. HCL does not want Super-Mart's fitting out work to affect the OP of the building. HCL is also keen to accommodate this request since the existence of a supermarket will attract more people to their development.

Following a meeting, the Architect has advised that the early completion and handover of the ground floor is feasible given that the OP will have been obtained 4 weeks before the handover of the whole building.

You, as the Consulting Quantity Surveyor, are asked to:

(a) advise whether it is necessary to amend the tender documents to deal with the above issues; and [Sub-total for item (a): 5 marks]

(b) give a list of the various parts of the tender documents and describe with reasons what provisions would need to be amended or added. There is no need to draft the provisions. [Sub-total for item (b): 10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Rectification of spalling concrete
		- Having not provision for this work in the tender documents means that if the work is instructed for at a later stage it would be treated as a variation to the Contract and will certainly have time and cost implications.
		- SE has advised that the rectification work is critical and would have an impact on the completion of the whole of the Works.
		- Including the work now into the scope of the Works will therefore avoid the need to claim for and assess EOT and L&E. The completion date will be more certain.
		- Having the work priced for and included in the tenders will avoid the need to value the work using star rates, which would probably be less competitive after contract award. The final contract sum will be more certain.
		- It is therefore important to include the rectification work in the tender documents by way of a tender addendum.
	- Early handover of ground floor
		- Although a milestone date has been set for the OP to be obtained earlier, the MC has no obligation to complete and hand over any parts of the Works unless mutually agreed between MC and Employer. To enter into such an agreement after contract award, the related time and cost implications, impact on other issues like damages for delay, safety and damage liability, insurance coverage, disruptions, constraints, the start of different defects liability periods, etc. Will all need to be negotiated. This would pose uncertainty to the earlier handover date and the final contract sum.
		- It is therefore important to include such a requirement in the tender documents by way of a tender addendum providing for a sectional completion.
- B
	- Appendix to CC
		- Spalling
			- Contract period should be reasonably increased to give longer time to accommodate rectification work which would need at least 40 calendar days. The increase may not necessarily be exactly 40 calendar days. It can be more or less but some explanation should be given. 
		- Early handover
			- A separate completion date should be specified for the completion of the relevant portion of the ground floor earlier than the whole of the Works. This should be more than 30 days earlier to give some buffer for delays but cannot be earlier than OP date.
			- Names of sections, dates for completion, LAD, DLP
		- Bonus
			- How to fix DLP of the section completed earlier (2005 SFBC specified)
			- Who will take out and maintain separate insurance coverage for the section completed earlier and people working there
			- Whether the bond amount will be partially released (not for 2005 SFBC)
			- Whether the retention money will be partially released (2005 SFBC specified)
	- Technical specification
		- Rectification of spalling concrete
	- Preliminaries
		- Spalling
			- Add in scope of works
			- Contract period if specified in SP
			- Reference should be made to the structural survey report showing the extent of spalling concrete. The report may be added as an appendix to the tender documents or declared to be made available for inspection. The liability for the accuracy of such survey report would usually be mentioned also.
		- Early handover
			- Sectional completion and early handover
			- Indication of extent of relevant portion with reference to drawing
			- Any special requirements related to the sectional completion: e.g. re-positioning of and additional hoardings, re-routing of access to the site after sectional completion
			- Early completion of any major equipment which may be located outside the are of the ground floor but need to be activated in order to enable the completed parts to function: e.g. early completion of the chillers
			- Provision for re-sequencing of the works and disruptions due to completion in sections
			- Insurance arrangement for section completed earlier and people working there
			- Other requirements affected by the changes
	- Preambles
		- Spalling
			- The preambles should be checked to see whether there have already been clauses dealing with spalling concrete rectification to be compatible with the actual method of measurement used. If negative, special clauses should be added.
	- Measured bills
		- Spalling
			- BQ shall be amended to include the spalling concrete rectification work by way of provisional qty.
	- Drawing schedule
		- Amended to reflect any amended or additional tender drawings
	- Tender drawings
		- Spalling
			- Drawings showing the extent of spalling concrete and the detailed treatment method should be added to the tender drawings
		- Early handover
			- Drawings showing extent of the ground floor to be sectionally completed together with any access and partitioning requirements should be added
	- Appendix
		- Spalling
			- Structural survey report
	- Contents, collection and summary pages
		- Amendments required to suit any additional or amended parts or pages

## Question

Question No. 3 - Letter of Acceptance [15 marks]

Whilst awaiting the return of tenders for the Main Contract, the Employer has advised you that his Purchasing Department has confirmed a Vendor's quotation for the supply and installation of a large sized outdoor promotion display poster. The display poster is approximately 10m (high) x 6m (wide) and is intended to be mounted on the scaffolding that is to be erected by the Main Contractor at the external wall.

The Employer is concerned about 3 issues: (a) how the timing of the poster installation will interface with the Main Contractor's works, (b) the subsequent maintenance of the poster due to possible damage caused by inclement weather, and (c) the removal of the poster. It is the Employer's intention that the poster will only be displayed for a period of 3 months in the middle of the 12 months Main Contract period.

The Employer wants you as his Consulting Quantity Surveyor to draft a Letter of Acceptance incorporating the essential terms and addressing his 3 concerns for agreement by the Vendor.

Before preparing the draft Letter of Acceptance, your Senior Associate requested you to review the Vendor's quotation and draft in bullet points the usual and particular terms that should be incorporated in the Letter of Acceptance with elaboration on reasons of incorporation, in particular on how the concerns of the Employer should be addressed to facilitate the discussion with the Vendor in preparation for the agreement of the Letter of Acceptance. The complete draft of the Letter of Acceptance is not required.

A copy of the Vendor's quotation is attached for your reference.

Please reply by writing an internal memo to the Senior Associate stating the bullet points and the elaboration.

## Question

Question No. 4 - Prime Cost Rates and Prime Cost Sums

You received an email from the Employer's representative who wished you to explain to him the differences between prime cost rates and prime cost sums.

Please draft an email reply. [5 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- PC sum
	- PC sum are lump sums included in the Contract Sum to cover the cost of parts of the work which are not measured in BQ
	- It is a sum provided for work or services to be executed by NSC / NS. The reason of using the prime cost sums are to give the Architect control over the choice to firm to carry out the work, particularly where it is of a specialist nature or outside the scope of work normally carried out by general contractors, and to enable the Architect to select articles and materials manufactured by particular firms.
	- MC is allowed to price for an attendance which is a lump sum amount for works carried out by NSC. Profit can also be allowed, which is inserted as a percentage, on the workdone by NSC.
	- PC sum is deemed to be exclusive of MC's profit. Provision is made in BQ and specifications for a separate addition which is normally calculated as a percentage of the PC sum.
	- Where the Contract Sum is adjusted by the omission of PC sum and the substitution of actual costs incurred, the profit amounts will be correspondingly adjusted on a pro-rata basis.
	- Attendances are usually treated as fixed sums which, unlike profit, will not be adjusted on a pro-rata basis to the actual cost incurred.
- PC rate
	- Where PC rates are included in the description of items, they are either for the material cost of items or are for the supply and installation of items (e.g. engineering wood, kitchen cabinet)
	- PC rate is a rate for a specified item of work to be supplied or supplied and installed by the contractor. It is a nominal rate given by Employer and to be adopted by the tenderers in their marking up of the all-in rate for that specified item. The all-in rate coverage will usually be detailed in the measurement rules stated in the Preambles
	- The contract rates will be adjusted by the nett difference between the PC rate and actual price and will be applied to the nett quantity of the items measured as fixed, installed or applied in position

#Payment
## Question

Question No. 1 - Valuation of Interim Payment [12 marks]

You are working for a Main Contractor and are appointed as the Project Quantity Surveyor for a residential development.

Your company submitted Payment Application No. 15 ("PA No. 15") on 6th September 2010. The site visit for payment valuation was attended by the representative of the Consulting Quantity Surveyor and yourself on the same day.

On 10th September 2010, the Consulting Quantity Surveyor sent you a draft payment valuation of PA No. 15 for your preliminary information. Earlier this morning. Your boss discussed with you his comments on the draft payment valuation. You then called the representative of the Consulting Quantity Surveyor and he told you the reasoning behind his draft payment valuation.

- Your boss' comments on and the Consulting Quantity Surveyor's reasoning behind the draft payment valuation are listed as follows:

## Assessor Notes

- 1
	- According to cl. 32.2(2) & 3(a) of SFBC 2005/6, the estimated valuation of the work in progress shall include the value of the permanent work properly carried out.
	- QS's IP valuation shall be the value of work properly carried out irrespective of or with corrections for any errors in MC's submitted amounts in his payment application
	- Therefore, the estimated valuation of work in progress for the works shall be 80% not wrong application of 60%.
- 2
	- According to cl. 32.2(2) & (3)(d) of SFBC 2005/6, the estimated valuation of the work in progress shall include the value of materials on site provided that:
		- They are to be incorporated into the permanent works
		- They have not been prematurely delivered; and 
		- They are adequately protected against weather, other damage or theft
	- Although MC has wrongly applied under the work done instead of MOS, QS should not deprive the MC of his right to payment for MOS if properly delivered and protected.
	- Whether MC has fully paid his subcon the value of the delivered materials or not (which may be due to the differences between payment terms in MC and subcon) should not affect MC's entitlement to payment for MOS
	- Obviously, the delivered materials are for the permanent works and have not been prematurely delivered as the same will be installed in the coming week. If the delivered materials are adequately protected, the value of the said material should be included in the payment valuation
- 3
	- Clause 4.2(1) of SFBC 2005/6 states that Architect's confirmation / no objection to verbal instruction can take effect to variation.
	- If the CVI has been properly issued by MC, and has not been dissented to inwriting by Architect, oral instruction requiring a variation shall take effect
	- Architect's verbal instructions were given on 12/4. CVI was issued to confirm on 14/4. As the Architect has not dissented  in writing within 7 days from 14/4, the confirmed variation has taken effect.
	- In Architect's Letter, Architect confirmed the CVI and provided with further information. It is therefore a valid Architect's Instruction given to the MC in writing. CC do not require the AI to be a particular form or bear a particular serial number.
	- According to the Contract, the estimated valuation of the work in progress shall include the value of the permanent work properly carried out including additional work instructed as a variation. It should include the additional work covered by MC's valid CVI and AI.

#Variation 
## Question

- Question No. 2 - Valuation of Variation Work [13 marks]
	In the Bills of Quantities of a commercial complex project with 3 levels of shopping arcade, the glazed shop-front partitions are measured and priced for in the BQ items as abstracted below:
	
	![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805124652.png)
	To cater for a structural amendment during the post contract stage, the storey heights of Levels 1 and 2 have been revised from 4m to 4.5m . The Architect has issued an instruction (A.l. No. 131) to the Main Contractor to revise correspondingly the heights of the glazed shop-front partitions on Levels 1 and 2. The Main Contractor has refused to use the BQ rate of Item 3.6.2 for the valuation of this variation and has issued a letter to the Project Manager (Main Contractor's letter is attached as Appendix 2A) giving his reasons as to why the said BQ rate is inappropriate. With regard to this issue, the Project Manager has written to seek your advice (Project Manager's letter is attached as Appendix 2B). Acting as the Consulting Quantity Surveyor, you are requested to reply the Project Manager's letter to address his concerns.

	Attention: Mr. Project Manager
	
	Dear Sirs,
	
	Re: Proposed Commercial Development in Mong Kok
	
	Reference is made to the Architect's Instruction No. 131 regarding the revision of the heights of the internal glazed shop-front partitions due to the revised storey heights (from 4m to 4.5m ) on Levels 1 and 2 of the captioned project.
	
	We write to express our objection to the use of the BQ rate (Item 3.6.2 in the Bills of Quantities) for the glazed shop-front partitions on Level 3 as the basis for valuing the revised shop-front partitions on Levels I and 2 on the following grounds:-
	
	1. The BQ rate in Item 3.6.2 was substantially under-priced because of a pricing error. 
	2. There are substantial increases in the total areas of the shop-front partitions as a result of the variation.
	
	Based on the above, we do not agree to the use of the BQ rate as the basis for valuing the variation. If a "star rate' is not agreed, we will not commence the aforesaid variation work.
	
	Thank you for your attention and your soonest response will be much appreciated.
	
	Yours faithfully, For and on behalf of FitBuild Construction Co., Ltd.

## Assessor Notes

- 1
	- If based on SFBC 2005, the valuation rules in cl.13.4(1) regarding the valuation of "additional or substituted work which can be properly valued by measurement" can be applied:
		- (i) (ii) (iii) (iv)
- 2
	- Valuation using star rate means using fair rates or fair valuation
	- SFBC 2005 cl.13.4(1)(iii) stipulates that fair rates should only be applied where the variation work is not the same as or similar in character to any work priced in BQ
	- SFBC 2005 cl.13.4(1)(i)&(ii) stipulate that where the conditions of carrying out work of same or similar character has changed or the qty of the work has been substantially changed, BQ rates should still apply subject to a fair adjustment for the difference in conditions or quantity. It shall be adjustment for the difference not a complete review of BQ rate.
	- Pricing error inherent in the BQ rate is not a result of the change in conditions or quantity and is therefore irrelevant to a fair valuation. BQ rates shall still be used as the base for further adjustment for the difference in conditions or qty.
	- The partitions after variation are of the same character as the partitions before variation, except for the height. The height after variation matches the description of BQ item 3.6.3. Therefore, the rate for BQ item 3.6.2 should apply by default.
	- The partitions on L1 & L2 do not appear to be executed under different conditions to those on L3 thus warranting an adjustment of BQ rates, unless the MC can demonstrate otherwise, such as:
		- Very different working sequence and working conditions
		- Actual heights on L1&2 very different from the actual height on L3 due to different structural frames even though the storey heights are the same
	- The area of partition on L1&2 would be changed from 1000m2 to roughly 1125m2. Although this 1125m2 appears to be more than double the 500m2 on L3, it is only 125m2 more than 1000m2. This does not appear to be a substantial increase in the total qty, bearing in mind also that the rate of $2800/m2 for 4.5 high partition is already higher than the rate for 4m high partition. If the BQ rate adjustment is worked from $2500/m2, it may not be as good as $2800/m2. Therefore, it does not appear that the BQ rate should be adjusted for change in qty, unless MC can demonstrate that the details of 4.5 high partition are very different from 4m high such that the two groups of partitions should be considered separately when the quantity effect is considered.
- 3
	- Cl.4.3(1) of SFBC 2005 - MC has an obligation to comply with all instructions that Architect is empowered by the CC to issue
	- Cl.13.1(1) of SFBC 2005 - the Architect may issue an instruction requiring a Variation. One of the conditions likely to be relevant to the present case is that the Variation shall not fundamentally change the scope or nature of the Works. However, this present variation does not appear to fundamentally change the scope or nature of works. Therefore, the variation instruction is a valid instruction which MC has to comply with
	- Cl.4.3(2) of SFBC 2005, if the MC disagrees that the Architect is empowered to issue a particular instruction, he may within 7 days of receipt of that instruction require the disagreement to be resolved under cl.41 - settlement of disputes
	- Cl.4.3(3) of SFBC 2005, the Employer may employ and pay other persons to execute the work and recover all additional costs incurred by Employer from MC under cl.40 or as a debt, unless eventually resolved that the variation was not valid.
- 4
	- If an omission is a valid variation, the valuation of the omission should be based on the BQ rates. If the omission causes the MC to incur expense which could not be recovered due to the valuation based on the BQ rates, e.g. the cost of preparation of shop drawings which has not been priced for separately, the expense should be compensated. If the omission causes MC to incur additional costs to carry out the remaining quantity of work partially omitted, e.g. some fixed costs now shared by smaller remaining quantity, the additional cost incurred in carrying out the remaining quantity of work should be compensated. However, loss of profit due to the omission if not claimable.
	- SFBC 2005 cl.13.1(1)(b) regarding the Architect's authority to instruct Variation stipulates that MC's written consent is required for an instruction omitting work in order for it to be carried out by others.
	- Since MC is claiming that the partitions have been underpriced, there may not be a prospect for claiming for loss of profit. But where his consent is required under SFBC 2005, MC would try to bargain for some compensation.
	- Apart from the valuation principle, there are a lot of other issues like the works programme, complication of another another shop-front contract coming onto the site, access and working space, attendance, interfacing with adjoining work, liability for damage, etc. Which the project team has to review, if another contractor is employed to carry out the shop-front partition work.

## Question

Question No. 3 - Cost Estimate for Potential Variation Work [12 marks]

You are the Consulting Quantity Surveyor for a school project which is scheduled for completion within the next 60 days in accordance with the programme.

Other than the School Block, the school project also includes a Hall Block. The Hall Block comprises Stage Area (200m2) on G/F, Multi-function Hall (600m2) on G/F, Balcony Floor (150m2) (which is partially at mid-level of Multi-function Hall) and other areas. (Note: The areas in brackets are internal floor areas.)

The Employer's Project Manager called you this morning and requested for your cost estimate for the following potential variation of painting work to the Hall Block.

- PV No. 1. 
	Add black colour emulsion paint on concrete surfaces of soffits and beams above the Stage Area (8.0 m high from G/F), the Multi-function Hall (9.5m high from G/F at the portion without Balcony Floor), and the Balcony Floor (4.5m high from Balcony Floor).
	
	Quantities of paint area =
		​(a) 240m2 (for soffits and beams above Stage Area); 
		(b) 540m2 (for soffits and beams above Multi-function Hall at the portion without Balcony Floor); and 
		(c) 180m2 (for soffits and beams above Balcony Floor).

- PV No.2. 
	Change the colour of plastered soffits and beams of Balcony Floor 4.8m high from floor of Multi-function Hall) from white colour to black colour by adding two coats of black colour emulsion paint on top of the completed emulsion paint.
	
	Quantity of paint area = 180m2

- PV No. 3. 
	Change the colour of plastered walls and columns from white colour to brown colour by adding two coats of brown colour emulsion paint on top of the completed emulsion paint.
	
	Quantity of paint area = 1,000m2

- PV No. 4. 
	Change the colour of the galvanized metal balustrades (25m x 1.35m high) at Balcony Floor from white colour to brown colour by adding one undercoat and one finishing coat of brown colour synthetic paint on top of the completed synthetic paint.

As of today, all items of work (including painting work) at the Hall Block have been completed except the timber flooring and skirting to the Stage Area, Multi-function Hall and Balcony Floor. The scaffoldings to ceilings have been dismantled. The scaffoldings to walls have been scheduled for dismantling early next week. The internal floors of the Hall Block have been cleared and are ready for installation of timber flooring and skirting after the dismantling and removal of the scaffoldings to walls.

The relevant parts of the Bills of Quantities are extracted from the Contract Documents as per Appendix 3A.

You have checked with the Main Contractor's Project Manager and he has confirmed that the said items of potential variation work at the Hall Block are not critical to the completion of the Works while the remaining works (including painting work) at the School Block are still being carried out in accordance with the programme. You are requested by the Employer's Project Manager to provide him with a cost estimate for the said items of potential variation work for his consideration by tomorrow. The Employer's Project Manager has also advised that he would require all these items of potential variation work to be carried out at the same time. Please include the general principles of valuation of variations, your assumptions and back-up calculations in your written reply.

## Assessor Notes

- As confirmed by MC, the said items of PVO are not critical to the completion. The cost estimate should not include the cost of acceleration and prolongation. Subject to reasonable assumptions, to follow the valuation rules of cl.13.4(1)(c) of SFBC 2005.
- PV No.1
	- The given qty of additional black colour emulsion paint on concrete surfaces of ceilings and beams are:
		- 180m2; 3.5-5.0m high
		- 780m2; 5.0-10.0m high
	- To work out fairly the rate for additional black colour emulsion paint on concrete surfaces of ceilings and beams, the unit rates for BQ item 4.11/1/B&C (i.e. 45/m2) shall be used as the basis for valuation. The additional cost of preparing concrete surfaces (say 10/m2) before applying primer shall be added on top. The assessed fair rate for additional black colour emulsion paint to concrete surfaces of ceilings and beams 3.5-5.0 high would be 55/m2. 
	- There is no BQ rate for work 5.0-10.0m high. The rates for BQ items 4.11/1/B&C at different heights are the same. It may be argued that the rates would not change for different height. However, since the height 5.0-10.0m is much greater than 3.5-5.0m, the time taken to travel up to that height should be longer. It would be reasonable to add some extra in this respect, say $2/m2. The cost of scaffolding is to be dealt with separately.
- PV No.2
	- The given quantity of additional two coats of black colour emulsion paint on the soffits and beams is 180m2; 3.5-5.0m high
	- To work out fairly the rate for additional two costs of emulsion paint on the top of completed emulsion paint, the rate for BQ item 4.11/1/C (i.e. 45/m2) shall be used as the basis of valuation. Assuming that the primer coat is 17/m2, the assessed rate for the additional rate for the additional two coats of emulsion paint would be 28/m2
- PV No.3
	- Similar to above
- PV No.4
	- The qty of additional one undercoat and one finishing coat of brown colour synthetic paint on top of the completed synthetic paint on galvanized metal balustrades is 67.5m2 (measure both sides). 
	- To work out fairly the rate for additional works, the unit rate for BQ item 4.11/1/D (i.e. 52.5/m2 for one side) should be used as the basis of valuation. Assuming that the primer cost if 15/m2, the assessed rate would be 25/m2.
- Scaffolding
	- As scaffolding to ceilings have been dismantled, scaffolding to ceilings should be re-erected for applying additional paint. The qty to ceilings are: 
		- 300m2; 3.5-5.0m for concrete surfaces above balcony floor and plastered soffits and beams of balcony floor above m-hall
		- 650m2; 5.0-10.0m for concrete surfaces above stage area and m-hall at the portion w/o balcony floor
	- Acceptable star rates for scaffolding to ceiling shall be allowed.
	- Assuming that Employer's PM would confirm the potential variation work before dismantling of the scaffoldings to walls, there is no need to re-erect the scaffolding to walls for applying additional paint on wall.
- Protection and general cleaning
	- Protection of the completed work such as light fittings and windows should be carried out before applying the additional paint. Acceptable star rate for protection work should be allowed for in the cost estimate.
	- Extra general cleaning and removal of debris are required after completing the additional painting work and removal of the protection work. Acceptable star rate should be allowed for in the cost estimate.

## Question

Question No. 4 - Outstanding Work [13 marks]

In yesterday's Project Meeting, you were advised that the Employer was in the process of reviewing the colour scheme of the wall paper to be installed in the common corridors of the office building from 1/F to 20/F. It was also discussed that the Board of Directors would take about 2 months to finalise the colour scheme of the wall paper. The Main Contractor also confirmed that there were available stocks of the wall paper in the market and it would require 3 days for the delivery of the wall paper to the site upon the confirmation of the colour scheme.

The Architect advised in the same meeting that as all the statutory inspections of the building have already been completed to the satisfaction of the various statutory authorities, the wall paper will remain as the only outstanding original Contract work that could not be completed before the handover of the building to the Employer which has been scheduled to take place 4 weeks from now. The Employer has reiterated in the meeting that the handover cannot be delayed or rescheduled as there will be tenants moving in to start business by that time.

The Employer would like you, as the Consulting Quantity Surveyor, to advise him on the following:

(a) Whether the outstanding colour scheme confirmation of the wall paper would be a valid ground for the Main Contractor to claim for both extension of time and direct loss and expense, and what the contract provisions are. [Sub-total for item (a): 3 marks]

(b) While the Employer considers that the wall paper issue is minor in nature, whether contractually the Employer is entitled to take over the building leaving the Main Contractor to carry out and complete the wall paper at a later time. If yes, what are the contract provisions? If no, how can the rights and liabilities of both contracting parties be secured if the wall paper were to be carried out after the handover of the building to the Employer. [Sub-total for item (b): 5 marks]

(c) If the decision on the colour scheme of the wall paper is confirmed by the Board of Directors in the coming 14 days, whether there are any provisions under the Contract to have the work completed prior to the scheduled hand over date of the building, given that the Employer is well aware that the normal time required for the delivery and completion of the wall paper is approximately 6 weeks. If yes, what are the contract provisions. If no, what would be your advice to the Employer on the arrangement that could have the work completed on time and the rights and liabilities of both contracting parties secured. [Sub-total for item (c): 5 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- The late confirmation of the colour scheme by Employer will cause delay to the completion of the wall paper installation before the scheduled handover date of the building. Under SFBC, this will constitute a ground for MC's entitlement to both EOT and L&E.
	- Under SFBC clauses entitling EOT
		- NOD cl.25.1(1)(2), 25.2
		- Late instruction 25.1(3)(l)
	- Under SFBC clauses entitling L&E
		- NOC cl.27.1(1), cl.28
		- Late instruction cl.27.1(2)(g)
- B
	- Valid ground for substantial completion
		- SFBC cl.1.6 defines "substantially completed".
		- Usually it is the MC who wishes to have the works certified substantially completed as soon as the works the works can be taken over and used by Employer for their intended purpose. The Architect cannot refuse the certification because of the presence of some minor unfinished items of work. Therefore, the definition if for the protection of the MC. However, it does not mean that the definition cannot be used for the benefit of the Employer.
		- SFBC cl.17.1, the Architect can certify substantial completion when he considers that the state has been reached. There is no expressed need for MC to apply.
		- Since all the statutory inspections of the building have already been completed, the building is scheduled for handover in 4 weeks' time for occupation and use, with the wallpaper left as the only outstanding original contract work, there is no reason why the Architect cannot certify substantial completion at the same time and require the wallpaper to be completed later.
	- Avoid EOT claim
		- MC would insist on treating the wallpaper work as an inseparable part of the works to be completed before substantial completion in cases where he wants to rely on the EOT to help his other delays. The Architect cannot certify substantial completion as long as the building is not ready for handover due to MC's delay but once the delay is finished, the Architect can do so without waiting for the wallpaper work. MC's wish to rely on the delay to the wallpaper work may not be realised.
		- An expressed instruction that the wallpaper work will be postponed after substantial completion or a notice that the wallpaper work will be omitted from the Contract if MC challenges the right to postpone will prevent MC to have wishful thinking of relying on the delay to the wallpaper work to save his own delays.
		- While the validity of the postponement and the omission may be an issue, any adverse implication would be outweighed by the benefit of taking over the building for use earlier
	- Practical issues
		- The insurance policies would usually cover the rectification of defects or the carrying out of outstanding work during DLP. Practically, there is seldom need to have any extra agreement to deal with such outstanding work. Extra protection work or safety precautions may be required for the carrying out of wallpaper work after substantial completion because tenants have already moved in.
- C
	- If the colour can be confirmed within 2 weeks and the reasonable time to deliver and complete the wallpaper is 6 weeks, the total will be 8 weeks. This will be longer than the scheduled time for handover in 4 weeks from now. If really required to be completed before the scheduled time for handover, acceleration measures are required.
	- SFBC cl.26 defines procedural details for agreeing delay recovery measures.
	- However, in essence, the terms of any delay recovery measured / acceleration measures are still subject to negotiation and agreement between the Contract Parties, e.g. price, target time, measures, implication if target missed, etc should all be negotiated and agreed.
	- A supplementary agreement to cover the terms will do.

## Question

Question No. 1 - Cost Estimate

Your company is the Quantity Surveying Consultant for a new post-graduate students hostel project and your company has just submitted a Preliminary Cost Plan ref. CP1 (Appendix 1A) for the project to the Employer.

This morning, your Senior Associate left the following email from the Employer on your desk and asked you to carry out an independent preliminary check. The Cost Plan was prepared by your colleague who is now out of town and cannot be reached and you are not expected to search his files now.

Please carry out the following:

(a) Describe in bullet points of the suitable approach when dealing with reconciliation between two cost estimates; and [5 marks]  

(b) Respond to the email from the Employer by identifying the key differences in construction costs between the two projects. Note that the Cost Plan may not necessarily be perfect. A comprehensive reconciliation statement is not required. [10 marks]

- Attachment
	Dear Q.S.,
	
	Re: New Post-Graduate Students Hostel Project, Star Road, Chaiwan
	
	Thank you for your Preliminary Cost Plan ref. CP1 which will be discussed at our forthcoming Project Control meeting to be held tomorrow morning.
	
	Our organization recently completed a similar project: Youth Hostel, Kwun Tong, and according to our cost data, the cost/m2 CFA was much lower than that in your Preliminary Cost Plan ref. CP1. We are expecting members of the Project Control Group will want to know the key reasons for the difference in construction costs between the two projects.
	
	We attach herewith for your information an elemental cost analysis for the Youth Hostel Project (Appendix 1B) prepared based on the recently completed final account.
	
	We would appreciate if you could respond to us urgently. Thank you !
	
	Regards,  
	W. Lam  
	Employer's Representative

	2.0 Description of the Project
	
	2.1 The Preliminary Cost Plan Ref. CP1 is for the construction of one Post Graduate Students Hostel Block at Star Road, Chaiwan (15 storeys above ground without basement, approximately 40m×26 m overall on plan) with 50% of the bed-places provided at a new extension wing, and the remaining bed-places provided within an existing staff quarters (10 storeys above ground without basement, approximately 55 m x 30 m overall on plan). Extensive alterations have been allowed to convert the existing staff quarters into post-graduate students hostel.
	
	2.2 The Project also includes extensive site formation and slope stabilization to the slopes adjacent to the Site and extensive external works on the Site.
	
	3.0 Exclusions
	
	3.1 The following items have been specifically excluded from this Preliminary Cost Plan:
	
	(a) Land costs;  
	(b) Employer's administrative costs, finance costs and legal fees;  
	(c) Statutory and public utilities fees and charges;  
	(d) Works outside the site boundaries (except slope stabilization); 
	(e) Consultants' fees and site supervision costs; and  
	(f) Escalation in tender prices and/or construction costs beyond the current price level.
	
	4.0 Basis of Estimate
	
	4.1 The Preliminary Cost Plan is based on September 2011 prices for contracts of a similar duration obtained by competitive tendering. No provision has been made for future escalations in tender prices and/or construction costs beyond the current price level. The current available tender price index of Architectural Services Department is 1273 (2011 - 1st Quarter).
	
	5.0 Outline Specification

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Pre-condition
		- Check whether the two projects are comparable
	- Identify difference
		- Identify differences in the scope
		- Identify differences in design standards after aligning scope and price levels
		- Identify differences in unit rates after adjusting for TPI
		- Check percentage allowances
	- Justify the differences
	- Make appropriate adjustment of time difference (e.g. adjust for tender price indices)
	- Check further if apparent reasons not sufficient
	- Self check
		- Check arithmetic
		- Bulk check the qty
	- Tabulate a side by side comparison table
	- Check with persons responsible
	- Check files when persons responsible not present
- B
	- Comparability
		- It should be highlighted that while both projects are for student hostels requiring comparable provisions, KT was a completely new building, and CW involves the conversion of the existing staff quarters.
	- Scope
		- CW involves additional scope of works for demolitions, alterations, jointing between the existing and the new, BMU, site formation and slope stabilization
	- Arithmetical check
		- There should be a statement that arithmetical check has been done. Evidence of the check is not absolutely required
	- Comparison table
		- A comparison table is not absolutely necessary but would help identify areas of differences. Merits should be given if a reasonable comparison table is given
	- Difference in price levels
		- CW is based on 9/2011 without fluctuation.
		- KT is based on 6/2009. 
		- Adjustment should be made to bring the price levels up-to-date using TPI.
	- Demolitions
		- CW includes extensive demolitions inside the existing staff quarters.
		- KT is based on new construction with no demolition required.
	- Foundations and substructure
		- CW's rate indicates piled foundation. However, there should be savings in using the existing foundations of the staff quarters. The elemental cost/m2 is only a fraction of the current usual element cost/m2.
		- KT's rate indicates a shallow footing system. Further check with Employer would be required.
	- Structural frames
		- CW includes extensive alterations to the structural frame of the existing staff quarters to convert it to suit a student hostel. However, it would not be justifiable if the elemental cost/m2 of altering an existing structure should be more than building a new structure, unless historic building preservation is required.
		- KT is based on new construction.
	- Roof structure and covering
		- Any attempt should be made to convert the elemental cost per CFA to elemental cost per roof area for both projects for comparison. The presence of the existing roof structure of the staff quarters should also be accounted for
	- External walls
		- Any attempt should be made to convert the elemental cost per CFA to elemental cost per elevation area for both projects for comparison. The presence of the existing external walls of the staff quarters should be accounted for. Windows may or may not need to be replaced. 
		- The standards of external finishes and cladding may be difference. The presence of a BMU may indicate that the external elevations are treated with glass or metal cladding.
	- BMU
		- CW allowed for
		- KT not provided
	- BS works
		- The number of lifts v the floor area may be a factor causing the cost/m2 difference
	- Site formation and external works
		- CW has extensive site formation, slope works and external works allowed
		- KT only has minimal works
	- BEAM Plus platinum rating
		- CW allowed for
		- KT not required
	- Design and construction contingencies
		- As the elemental cost analysis for KT is based on agreed final accounts, all variations would have been included in the individual cost items. However, as CW is still in the design stage, it is prudent to leave an allowance for design and construction contingencies to cover change of design requirements, technological changes, and changing market conditions.

## Question

Question No. 2 - Tender Procurement

You are the Consulting Quantity Surveyor and your Senior Associate left a note on your desk this morning before going out for a meeting and asked you to draft a letter in response to the queries raised by the Employer's Representative concerning the tender for the Heavy Warehouse & Office Building Development at 123 Yuen Long Road.

Ref. 999  
20 September 2011

Accurate Ltd.  
Room 123, Block ABC, High Block, Central,  
Hong Kong

Attention : Mr. Q.S. Chan (Senior Associate)

Dear Q.S.,

Heavy Warehouse & Office Building Development at 123 Yuen Long Road Superstructure Contract - Tender

We refer to the consultant team's recent recommendation presented to our Management Group concerning the appointment of the contractor for the captioned Contract using a "Design & Build" contract approach.

The Vice Chairman of our Management Group asked several questions about the above recommendation.

Could you explain the situations where “Design & Build" contracts would be suitable or unsuitable? [4 marks]

Please briefly explain the tender evaluation process specifically for a Design & Build Contract. [3 marks]

What would be the criteria for selecting a Design & Build contractor in addition to those applicable to a Build Only contract and the information required from the Design & Build tenderers for checking against such criteria? [4 marks]

The Vice Chairman suggested inserting in the tender documents a daily rate ($3 million per day) equivalent to at least 1% of the estimated development cost ($300 million) of the project to cover the cost of each day of delay that might be caused by the contractor. He considered this substantial amount would deter the contractor from completing the Project beyond the proposed Contract Period of 15 months such that he could let out the property to prospective tenants as soon as possible since it is expected to have a very high demand of similar properties in that area. [4 marks]

We hope you could clarify the issues and provide us with a written reply as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully,

A. Chan  
Employer's Representative  
For and on behalf of Richman Development Co. Ltd.

## Assessor Notes

- A. suitability and unsuitability for D&B
	- Suitable
		- Design situation
			- Employer not having professional design consultants
			- Employer believes that their professional design consultants are too conservative in design
			- Employer has a definite design brief which is unlikely to be changed
			- Employer has open mind and would given flexibility for contractors to design and innovate
		- Buildability & specialty
			- Projects requires contractors who have the specialty design expertise not normally provided by professional design consultants
			- Projects requiring contractors who possess proprietary system or process or special construction plant
		- Liability
			- Employer wants to put all the design risks and liabilities upon the contractors
			- Employers requires contractors to take up a single point responsibility for design and construction
		- Time
			- Project needs fast track by overlapping the design and construction stages.
	- Not suitable
		- Design situation
			- Projects require only standard or well proven design leaving very little room for the contractor to improve
			- Project team already provides all the design details leaving very little flexibility for the contractor to design and save cost
			- Employer does not have a definite design brief
			- Project team is unable to draft a suitable design brief / Employer's requirement prior to tendering
			- Volatile user requirements and market situations demanding frequent changes to suit
		- Time
			- Mismatch of statutory submission diminishing the overlapping of the design and construction stages
		- Cost
			- Employer looks for maximizing price competition which may not be feasible due to limited number of contractors having track records of design and build
		- Contractor
			- There are limited number of contractors financially or technically capable of taking up the risks of design and build
			- Contractor unreasonably undercuts the design to cover their underpricing or maximize their profits
- B. tender evaluation process
	- Selection of a contractor is usually based on the price and technical submission of the tenderers. For D&B tenders, the technical submissions would be extended to include the tenderers' preliminary design proposals which would be the prime issue before all other things. 
	- For private sector projects, the price submission and technical submission would usually be opened up together, and the tender sums would initially set the priority for short-listing the tenderers for evaluation. The tenderers' preliminary design proposals would be checked to see whether they meet the minimum requirements of the design brief (Employer's requirements) included in the tender documents. If a preliminary design proposal fails to meet the conforming requirements, it will be disqualified and the next tender in the queue will be added to the short-list. Tender clarifications by means of questions and answers may be exchanged with shortlisted tenderers. Tender interviews are usually conducted. Private sector projects are more relaxed to entertain or even request for adjustments to the tender sums before contract award. Opportunity may be taken to iron out deviations from the design brief.
	- Apart from the practice as described above, it is not uncommon for some private developers to follow the tender opening procedures as adopted in the Gov project where the price submissions and technical submissions would usually be opened up and evaluated separately. A screening exercise may be conducted to ensure that a tenderer's preliminary design proposal meets the conforming requirements of the design brief before it is processed further. The technical submission will then be evaluated in details and given technical scores against pre-set criteria made known to tenderers. Tender clarifications would also be conducted but purely for the purpose of clarifications. Tender interviews are not usual but may be conducted. Adjustments to the tender sums before contract award would not be permitted. The price submission would be checked and scored separately. The price score and technical score would be combined together based on pre-set weighting also made known to tenders. The tender securing the highest score would be the winning bid.
	- Costs such as life cycle costs, cost implications of different designs, completion times, etc. May also be added to the tender sums for a total comparison.
	- Conforming requirements may include fundamentals like achieving the minimum amount of GFA / CFA, building height not exceeding the maximum height restrictions, providing sufficient loading, etc.
- C. selection criteria & information required
	- Suitable design
		- Demonstrated by preliminary design drawings with architectural plans, elevations and sections, perspectives and renderings, structural plans, E&M schematics, site and landscape layouts, descriptions of design parameters and standards, area schedules, schedule of accommodations, descriptions of functions, provisions and material standards, performance data, etc.
	- Good environmental impact
		- Demonstrated by analysis report on sun shading, visual impact, traffic impact, energy impact, pollution impact, etc.
	- Reasonable programme
		- Demonstrated by outline programme showing the key dates with due consideration of the design, statutory submission and construction times and inter-relationship
	- Reasonable construction methodology
		- Demonstrated by method statements showing understanding of site constraints, details of temporary works, detailed descriptions of design / construction sequences, etc.
	- Adequate construction plant / labour resource
		- Demonstrated by construction plant list showing the specialist plant used for the specialist design
	- Competent design and project management team
		- Demonstrated by an organization chart and CV showing the team structure, the roles, responsibilities, qualifications and track records of the key personnel for the proposed design team, project and construction management teams
	- Financial capable
		- Demonstrated by audited accounts and bank statements
	- Good track records
		- Demonstrated by job reference and performance appraisals by Employer
	- Competitive price
		- Demonstrated by the tender sums with breakdowns
	- Sustainable
		- Demonstrated by lift cycle cost plans and maintenance and repair requirements and cycles
	- Good marketability
		- Demonstrated by business plans if marketability (sale, lease or use) is also a requirement of the design brief
	- Other
		- Site safety plan, environmental plan, quality plan, waste management plan, energy efficiency, green features
- D. LAD
	- An Employer should not simply insert a LAD rate in the tender documents to deter the MC from late completion.
	- A LAD rate, to be enforceable, must be a genuine pre-estimate at the time of tendering of the probable loss and expense that the Employer may suffer from late completion, if a LAD rate is set at a higher rate than such a genuine pre-estimate, it will be regarded as a penalty and will not be enforceable. 
	- A LAD rate equivalent to 1% of the estimated development cost as suggested by Employer would on the face of it appear to be far in excess of the Employer's probable loss and expense and would appear to have the intention of penalizing the MC for completing late. This rate if challenged by MC may, in litigation, be retreated as penalty and not be enforceable. The Employer should really carry out a genuine pre-estimate to establish the LAD rate.
	- The probable loss and expense of the Employer due to late completion and hence delay in letting out the property may include loss of rental profits (revenue less running costs) based on reasonable occupancy rates, additional financial charges on the capital costs spent due to the prolonged period, additional consultancy and site supervision staff cost, additional administrative expenses, etc.
	- If LAD too high, it may deter tenderers from tendering.

## Question

Question No. 3 - Drafting of Contractual Terms

You are the Consulting Quantity Surveyor. Please draft a written response to the following letter sent to your company by the Employer:

Ref: 222  
20 September 2011

Accurate Ltd.  
Room 123, Block ABC, High Block, Central,  
Hong Kong

Attn: Mr. Q.S. Chan (Senior Associate)

Dear Q.S.,

Health Care Hospital Development Superstructure Contract

We know that the Main Contract tender documents for the captioned are under preparation. Please advise how to address the following issues in the Main Contract tender documents:

(a) The uncertain date of site possession because of some outstanding issue of the land lease. [5 marks]  

(b) The Employer intends to purchase directly from an overseas manufacturer for special sanitary fittings. These fittings are to be handed over to and installed by the Main Contractor (as part of the Main Contract: Works). [5 marks]  

We hope you can provide us with a written reply as soon as possible.  
Yours faithfully,.  
B. Lee  
Employer's Representative  
For and on behalf of Health Care Co. Ltd.

## Assessor Notes

- A. uncertain site possession date
	- Given possession of the site to MC is an implied term of contract. It is also usually expressed. The Employer would be in breach of the Contract if he fails to give site possession. Some standard forms of contract provide for EOT in case of delay to agreed site possession date. Some forms are silent in this respect and this may make the time at large in case of delay.
	- However, it is not uncommon that the exact site possession date is no known at the time of issuing the tender documents. 
	- It is also not uncommon that the site possession date is purposely left unstated to make it flexible to suit the tender award date or the actual site availability.
	- It is usual to specify the Contract Period as a period commencing from the actual site possession date, or a period having some relationship with the actual possession date, such that a fixed minimum construction period is available to the MC. Adjustment of the site possession date would have a corresponding adjustment of the completion date. Specific EOT is therefore not required.
	- If the site possession date is not specifically stated in the tender documents, it would be expected that the Contract would be awarded within the tender validity period, and the site possession date should be, at the latest, within a reasonable time after the tender validity period.
	- However, what would be considered as a reasonable time may lead to argument. Therefore, a range of time during which the site possession date may occur would be specified in the tender documents for the tenderers to judge the implications of holidays, bad weather conditions, inflations, availability of labour, etc.
	- Review of this range of time may be made during the tender evaluation stage. Private sector projects would be more relaxed to conduct negotiation in this respect during the tender evaluation stage. Gov projects would be more stringent to permit adjustment of tender requirements and tender sums at this stage.
	- If the actual site possession date is beyond the agreed range of time, then cost and time compensation might be required.
	- It may also be specified in the tender documents that delay up to a certain limit beyond a specific site possession date or a specific range of time will have no cost compensation. The tenderers would have to allow for such requirements.
	- If it is anticipated that the extent of the delay can vary very much, the tenderers may be requested to price separately for the daily rate of cost compensation for different extent of delay.
	- The Contract should not be awarded if there is still no prospect of making the site available. Otherwise, the Employer would be in serious breach of contract if the Contract cannot go ahead after award.
- B. Employer's direct purchase
	- The direct purchase arrangement would involve Employer in entering into two separate contracts, one with supplier, one with MC.
	- MC tender documents should deal with the following:
		- Declaration - a statement that the special sanitary fittings would be supplied by a supplier employed directly by the Employer
		- Ancillaries - description as to whether and what ancillary items are included or excluded
		- Quantities - who would be responsible for calculating the quantities to be ordered
		- Wastage and breakage - how much spares to cover wastages and breakage would be payable for by the Employer
		- Time - time to make the first and last order and time of delivery for the MC tenderers to judge whether this would be compatible with the overall programme
		- Delivery - delivery place, and MC's responsibility for taking delivery, off-loading, off-site storage, second handling, on-site hoisting, inspection, disposal of packings, etc.
		- Pricing - where the MC tenderers would have the opportunity to price for the above costs, as a separate item or as part of the installation costs
		- Installation - where the special sanitary fittings would require any special installation method
	- Employer should be cautioned that MC would not be responsible for any deficiencies in the non-performance of the supplier

## Question

Question No. 4 - Extension of Time

The Employer's Representative called you and expressed that the Employer was very anxious to have the project completed within the time stipulated in the Main Contract. They wish you, as their Consulting Quantity Surveyor, to clarify their following queries:

(a) the purpose of including the extension of time provisions in the Contract; [5 marks] 

(b) the possibility of deleting all extension of time entitlement clauses from the Contract to avoid possible future extension of time disputes because the Employer's project has a deadline to meet. [5 marks] 

## Assessor Notes

- A. purpose of EOT
	- It is an implied term of contract that the Employer should not hinder or prevent the MC from completing the works. If due to some fault of the Employer, MC is hindered or prevented from completing the works, MC is not bound to complete within the agreed completion time. The completion time is said to be at large. MC is only obliged to complete within a reasonable time, which may have no relationship with the agreed completion time at all. LAD for delayed completion would become not enforceable and only general damages for delayed completion beyond reasonable time can be claimed. Proving of general damages would be a difficult task.
	- Therefore, EOT clauses included in a contract are to preserve the right of the Employer by granting EOT to the agreed completion time to compensate MC for the time lost due to the Employer's or his agent's faults but at the same time keeping the agreed completion date as the base for adjustment. The right to deduct LAD by Employer is also retained.
- B. deletion of EOT
	- Omission or deletion of EOT in respect of Employer's fault would not reduce Employer's liability of MC's disputes, unless the tender documents are very specific with words beyond doubt that MC has to take up the consequences of some specific faults of the Employer.
	- The deletion of EOT will expose the Employer to greater risk, as any delaying event which has proved to be of the Employer's faults will legitimately give MC a valid claim for time extension. Without specific wordings to that effect, the deletion of EOT will not automatically imply MC would bear the consequences of such delay.
	- EOT also permit extension for natural events or some other events which are neither due to the Employer's or the MC's faults. These events are usually called neutral events. Permission of EOT of neural events is based on the consideration that the Employer is in a better position to take up the risk in case of the occurrence of neutral events. Such provisions may be deleted from the Contract but the tenderers would judge whether they would be able to allow for the risks or decline to tender.

#Defect #Insurance 
## Question

Question No. 1 -- Insurance Arrangement

Richman Development Co., Ltd. ("Richman") is the Employer and management company of an office building just recently completed. Three months after the building has been completed with Practical / Substantial Completion Certificate issued by the Architect, Richman would like to carry out some enhancement works including provision of signboards and LED decoration lighting features at the entrance lobby of the building with an estimated amount of about HK$100,000.

The Main Contractor is currently carrying out defects rectification for water leakage in the curtain wall of the building which is included in the Schedule of Defects issued by the Architect. The estimated amount for rectifying the defective works is around HK$ 1 million.

Moreover, the Main Contractor, in response to the urgent request of the management company of the building, is also replacing the broken glazing damaged by a typhoon last month, with a quotation submitted by the Main Contractor in an amount of HK$200,000. The Main Contractor's quotation for replacement of broken glazing stated that "All insurances for the replacement of broken glazing are excluded and to be arranged by others.".

The Employer would like to complete the above mentioned enhancement, defect rectification and urgent replacement works ("the Said Works") as soon as possible and would like you, as the Consulting Quantity Surveyor, to advise the following:

(a) the responsibilities and liabilities of the Main Contractor for the Said Works under the Main Contract; and [4 marks]  

(b) the types of insurances required for the Said Works (taking reference to and quoting the relevant contract provisions whether the insurance policies under the Main Contract are still applicable and justification for suitable insurance arrangement). [4 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- The enhancement works are not part of the present Contract and MC should not be liable for them under the present Contract.
	- MC should be liable for defects rectification works under SFBC 2005/6 cl.17.3(1).
	- For damage caused by typhoons after Substantial Completion, MC is usually not liable. However, since it is an external glazing, further investigation should be required. It is usually for the Contract to specify that the external glazing should withstand typhoons, which are a common natural phenomenon in Hong Kong. An external glazing which cannot withstand typhoons can be regarded as a non-compliance with the Contract, and MC should be liable to rectify the damage as his defects. 
	- However, if the damage was caused by a flying object caused by typhoon, it would appear beyond the performance requirements to withstand the natural typhoon forces, and MC should not be liable for the damage.
- B
	- Desirability
		- Usually, a construction contract would require insurance of the Works, third party liability insurance and employees' compensation insurance. The taking out of ECI is a statutory requirement, while the taking out of the other two is only a contractual requirement either to be responsible by MC or Employer. However, MC's liability for the care of the Works and towards employees and third party would not be changed in the absence of insurance. If MC qualifies to exclude the taking out of insurances, it should be clarified if the liability would remain the same. 
	- Applicability
		- Usually a CAR would be taken out to cover insurance of the works and third party liability. The insurance would provide cover for the period of insurance from commencement to end of defects liability period, except that that the material damage section of the policy would typically say that the insurance would not cover the part of the Works taken into use by the Employer unless the loss is occasioned during DLP and caused by an occurrence before completion.
	- Building management
		- Under Building Management Ordinance, the corporation of a building shall take out a third party liability insurance for the common parts of the building, and may take out property insurance for the common parts of the building. For buildings without corporations, it is prudent to have such insurances. The third party liability insurance may provide cover for liability arising from minor repair and maintenance works.
	- Arrangement
		- Insurance of the building
			- The building, being "the Works" under the present Contract, is no longer covered by the works insurance
			- It should be covered by a new property insurance effected by Employer after Substantial Completion
		- Insurance of the Works
			- The defects rectification works, being the residual part of the Works, would be covered by the typical insurance policy wordings. (maybe...)
			- Enhancement works are not the works under present Contract, and would need to be insured. 
				- The current policy may be specifically endorsed to cover.
				- The new property insurance of the building may be extended to provide the cover. 
				- However, it would be cheaper to effect a separate insurance either by E / MC rather than adjusting the bigger insurance
		- TPI
			- Defect rectification works covered by the insurance under present Contract
			- Enhancement works not covered by the insurance under present Contract
				- The current policy may be specifically endorsed to cover
				- The new TPI of the building may be able to cover id the value of enhancement works is smaller than the value of maintenance works in the policy.
				- However, it would be cheaper to effect a separate insurance either by MC / E rather than adjusting the bigger insurance
		- ECI
			- Defect rectification works covered by the insurance under present Contract
			- Enhancement works to be covered by a new insurance policy. In view of the statutory obligation and the small value involved, it should be effected by MC, unless there is already a master policy effected by Employer.
		- SFBC 2005/6
			- ECI / TPl: commencement until Defects Rectification Certificate
			- Insurance of the Works: commence until 14 days after Substantial Completion

## Assessor Notes

- 7.2.1. Protest
	- Firstly it should be checked whether the protest against "damage of the environment due to construction" was due to any improper construction activities by MC. If yes, MC should be responsible. If no, the reason could be due to the development of the project by Employer.
	- Obviously, the Employer would not have called upon the protesters, and he should therefore not be held liable for this.
	- However, if the protesters' action was incited by Employer, whether the Employer can be free of liability is doubtful.
	- As an argument for granting EOT, this may be treated as civil commotion which is an excepted risk under cl.1 and granted with EOT under cl.25.1(3)(d), but no L&E under cl.27.
	- As an argument against granting EOT, it is doubtful whether the scale of this amounts to civil commotion, which should affect the society at large.
	- Equitably, EOT without L&E entitlement should be granted.
- 7.2.2. Black rain & consequence
	- EOT is authorized under cl.25.1(3)(c). However it does not mention the consequential effects. While on one hand, consideration should be given to the full effects of the event, i.e. including consequential effects, on the other hand, by contrasting with cl.25.1(3)(b) which specifically mentions "consequences", it may be argued that consequential effects are excluded.
	- The extra two days for pumping work can only be considered under cl.25.1(3)(b) as the consequences of inclement weather provided that the conditions of inclement weather is fulfilled.
	- The above is based on the assumption that the Contractor had provide reasonable protection, and done his best endeavour to mitigate the consequence of black rainstorm.
	- No L&E entitlement under cl.27.
- 7.2.3. Late instruction then strike, but already under delay
	- Listed event and consequence
		- Provision of late information is a ground of EOT under cl.25.1(3)(l) and L&E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(g) provided a Notice of Claim has been made beforehand under cl.28.
		- A strike off-site affecting the delivery of materials is not a ground for EOT. However, if the strike could have been avoided has the provision of information not been late, then the effect of the strike should be taken into consideration if provision of late information is established.
	- MC is obliged to complete the Works by the original or extended date for completion. The Employer should not hinder MC from catching up his own delay.
		- The latest time to provide the information should be worked back from the earliest time that the MC could possibly start the tiling work, allowing reasonable time for ordering and delivery.
		- If the anticipated period of delay of 30 days was a realistic estimate, and could not possibly be caught up completely by MC, then the apparent 2 days' delay as compared to "MP-01" should not be considered as late, and the whole of 2 + 6 days would not qualify for EOT consideration.
	- Furthermore, whether the tiling work is on the critical path, should also be considered.
		- The relevance of master programme "MP-02" should be critically viewed because it was updated later than the delaying event and might have reflected the delay already.
	- In summary, the delay of 2 days would not appear to have a critical effect on the MC's best possible programme to achieve the original or extended Date for Completion, no EOT should be granted.
- 7.2.4. NSC suspend due to MC set off payment
	- According to MC cl.29.8(2) and NSC cl.33.1(7), MC is entitled to deduct any amount properly deductible from the certified payment, and NSC only has the right to suspend work under NSC cl.33.14(1) for the residual payment or if the amount deducted is not proper. 
	- In accordance with cl.29.8(3) and NSC cl.33.1(8), if the Architect considered that the deduction is not proper, he should certify accordingly direct payment.
	- Valid suspension of work would not have a direct EOT entitlement under MC cl.25.1, but would entitle NSC to EOT under NSC cl.25.1(3)(u), which would in turn trigger MC cl.25.1(3)(m). This would appear to be unreasonable for Employer to be responsible for the MC's default. MC cl.25.4 provides a solution that the event was actually caused by MC's default, the event would not give entitlement to EOT.
	- In the present case, the suspension event was caused by MC not Employer, therefore, no EOT would be justified.
- 7.2.5. AI for fence off antiquity but not affect work progress
	- Valuation of variation under cl.13.4.
	- EOT for variation under cl.25.1(3)(h), with L& E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(c).
	- EOT for arrangement in connection with discovery of antiquity under cl.25.1.(3)(k), with L&E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(f).
	- In this case, there is no disruption to normal work progress. Therefore, no EOT nor L&E entitlement.

## Question

Question No. 3 - Nomination of Sub-Contractor

The Architect has instructed the Main Contractor, Smart Construction Co., Ltd., to accept Top Speed Lifts (Hong Kong) Ltd. ("Top Speed") as the Nominated Sub-Contractor for Lift Installation for the Proposed Development of Mega Plaza via Architect's Instruction No. M-12 dated 19 September 2011 (See Appendix 3A).

However, the Main Contractor has verbally objected to the nomination due to the following reasons:

1. The Nominated Sub-Contract Sum is HK$2,680,000 only, which is far below the Prime Cost Sum of HK$5,000,000 for Lift Installation under the Main Contract. The Main Contractor will suffer a loss if the 5% profit allowed in the Main Contract is to be adjusted.
2. The payment terms for the Lift Installation Nominated Sub-Contract are totally different from the monthly progress payment terms stipulated in the Main Contract.
3. The rate of liquidated damages for the Lift Installation Nominated Sub-Contract is HK$10,000 per day only, which is significantly lower than the rate of liquidated damages under the Main Contract (i.e., HK$100,000 per day).
4. According to the tender programme submitted by Top Speed, the installation period, including the time for testing and commissioning, is 3 months, but the time for delivery of lift equipment is 1 month behind the Main Contractor's approved Master Programme (MP-01). As such, the completion of Lift Installation (including testing and commissioning) will be 1 month behind the Main Contractor's approved Master Programme MP-01. (An extract of Specification Preliminaries for Programme of Work, which forms part of the Nominated Sub-Contract, is attached as Appendix 3B.)

Your Associate Director of the Consulting Quantity Surveying firm is required to attend an ad-hoc meeting scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. You are requested to prepare a draft Report to give advice on the following:

(a) The respective contractual positions of the Employer and Main Contractor.  

(b) The possible ways to resolve the raised issues (i.e., the reasons for refusal of the nomination) and provide recommendations with consideration of time and cost aspects.

	2. Payment Terms:
	    - 30% upon award of the Nominated Sub-Contract
	    - 40% upon delivery of equipment
	    - 20% upon completion of installation
	    - 5% upon completion of testing and commissioning
	    - 5% upon completion of making good defects
	3. Liquidated Damages: HK$10,000 per day
	4. Programme of Lift Installation Work: As per submitted tender programme (not forming part of the Nominated Sub-Contract)
	
	The Sub-Contract Documents are being prepared and will be sent to you for your arrangement to complete the execution of the Sub-Contract with Top Speed shortly.


- Appendix
	[The following is extracted from the Contract Document]
	
	SPECIFICATION PRELIMINARIES
	
	3.11 Programme of Work
	
	Within two weeks of award of the Contract, the Main Contractor shall submit to the Architect for approval a detailed programme showing his intended method, stages and order of proceeding with the Works together with the period of time he has estimated for each and every such stage of progress. This programme will be an amplification of the outline programme submitted with the tender and it shall identify the critical path and the logical relationship between the construction activities, though it need not be in the form of a critical path network.
	
	The Main Contractor shall incorporate in his programme the Nominated SubContract Works for Lift Installation into his programme as follows: -
	
	(a) allow 1 month after award of Nominated Sub-contract for submission of shop drawings and samples; and  
	(b) allow 3 months for installation period and completion of testing and commissioning after handed over of lift shafts and machine rooms.
	
	The Nominated Sub-Contractor for Lift Installation shall follow the above schedule of works so as to suit the progress of the Main Contract Works.
	
	Once a month, or at such other intervals required by the Architect, the whole programme is to be reviewed and updated. The revised programme shall be submitted to the Architect clearly indicating the state of progress of the Works and the revisions necessary to achieve completion by the dates required in the Contract.
	
	If during the course of the Contract special circumstances should arise which in the opinion of the Architect warrant or necessitate a revision of departure from the order of procedure as shown in the approved programme, then the Main Contractor shall accordingly so revise his programme as the Architect may require.
	
	In order that the programme may be maintained or amended where necessary it is incumbent upon the Main Contractor to notify the Architect whenever there is the likelihood of a delay occurring in his own work or material supplies or in those of any of his sub-contractors. Failure of the Main Contractor to take such action will be prejudicial to consideration being given to requests for extension of time.
	
	The submission to and approval by the Architect of such programme (and revisions if applicable) shall not relieve the Main Contractor of any of his duties or responsibilities under the Contract.

## Assessor Notes

- Introduction / background
	- The key issues of the disputed matters shall be identified
- Purpose of the report
	- Advise the contractual positions of the E & MC, and the ways to solve the discrepancies between the terms and conditions of the proposed NSC and MC
- Contractual position of E & MC
	- Generally
		- If there is a PC Sum in the Contract for Lift Installation, the Architect is empowered to issue an instruction to nominate NSC (SFBC cl.29.1)
		- However, Architect should not nominated if the terms and conditions of the NSC deviate from the known terms and conditions
			- SFBC cl.29.2(1) stipulates that if the terms and conditions of NSC are different from those made known to the MC during his tendering, then the difference should be treated as a Variation
			- If MC does not raise objection at the time of nomination, he is deemed to have accepted any deviations from the defined terms and conditions
		- If there is no deviation from the known items and conditions, MC can still make reasonable objections under SFBC cl.29.2(1).
	- Big difference between NSC Sum and PC Sum
		- If MC argues that he is afraid that the NSC Sum is too low to be feasible, and this appears so when compared with other tenderers' prices, then this would be a valid ground for objection under cl.29.1(1)(c). If the NSC fails to perform, MC would take up the consequence unless and until there is a re-nomination. However, this is not the argument being adopted by MC. He is arguing against the profit becoming too low.
		- Profits priced in the Contract Sum on PC Sum should be recalculated based on the same profit percentage but on the final NSC Sum (cl.32.7(2)(a) & (3)(d)). This would mean a significant reduction in profit in the present case. 
			- It may be argued that since the above rules for adjusting MC's profit on the PC Sum have been clearly set out in the Contract, and a different between PC Sum and the NSC Sum should be expected and should not be a ground for the MC to objection to the nomination.
			- On the other hand, the difference between PC Sum and the NSC Sum is very significant and may be regarded as beyond the normal range of differences. The total profit that the MC expected has been much reduced.
			- However, the significant difference may still exist if other lift companies are nominated. This issue is not specific to the company being nominated and has nothing to do with his capability. It would therefore not be reasonable for MC to use this as a valid reason for objection.
		- The Archi should reply to MC that this objection to nomination is not valid.
		- The significant difference could be handled separately, taking into account whether the effect may be counter-balanced by other NSC Sum being greater than the PC Sum.
	- Different payment terms between NSC and MC
		- It is not important the MC's own payment terms are different from NSC's payment terms. Whether the NSC's payment terms are consistent with those made known to the MC during his tendering is more important. 
		- SFBC adopts the monthly progress payment method, the stage payment method would appear to be inconsistent with this, and should have been made known to MC during his tendering
		- If there is any inconsistency not made known to MC, he may make objection, but it should be noted that the standard form of main contract adopts a pay-when-paid system where MC would only need to pay NSC after he himself receives the payment from Employer. Therefore, so long as MC does not have to pay before he himself receives the payment, even though a monthly progress payment method is changed to a stage payment method, he would have no loss or liability requiring compensation.
		- Therefore, an objection due to inconsistency would not be strong enough to reject the nomination but would only serve the purpose of clarifying any doubt or registering a claim for the compensation if the doubt is proven
		- The solution should be to clarify in writing beyond doubt that the pay-when-paid arrangement is still in place, and the timing of stage payments should follow the regular monthly intervals, though the values are based on the agreed staged percentages.
	- Different rates of LAD between NSC and MC
		- The rate of LAD stipulates in MC is HK $100,000/day. However, the rate of LAD in NSC is HK$10,000/day.
		- If MC accepts the two different rates of LAD, he would be exposed to the difference if there is any delay caused by the NSC which would not entitle MC to EOT. Therefore, it would be reasonable for MC to raise objection.
		- This is a case of deviation from the known terms, SFBC would treat this as a variation. 
		- The solution should be to clarify in writing that MC's liability for LAD would be limited to HK$10,000/day in case of any delay that is solely due to the default of NSC.
	- Late delivery of lift equipment
		- If NSC's submitted preliminary programme is not compatible with MC's programme, it is reasonable for MC to seek clarification.
		- SFBC cl.29.2(1)(d) accepts this as a valid ground for objection.
		- It should be clarified and negotiated as necessary with NSC to deliver the lift equipment 1 months earlier or to shorten the installation, testing and commissioning period so as to suit MC's programme, possibly at some additional costs if his required longer times have not been cancelled.
		- Selecting the next tenderer meeting the shorter time is an option provided the letter of intent did not amount to a binding contractual commitment to keep the original NSC.
		- Negotiating with MC to accommodate the longer programme at some additional costs is another option
		- Permitting an EOT with L&E would appear to be last and expensive resort.
		- Re-tendering would not be an option because the time lost would likely be more than 1 month delay now in question.
		- Making the lift installation as a direct contract or making it not essential to Substantial Completion would not be welcome by MC if this means losing a good opportunity to secure EOT.
- Possible ways to solve the discrepancies between the terms and conditions of the proposed NSC and MC
	- Outline the possible way 
	- State the rationales and reasons for the recommendation
- Recommendation
	- Statement to recommend with back-up information and reasonable assumptions

## Question

Question No. 4 - Interim Payment Assessment

- Part A
	The Project Manager of the Employer, Mr. Albert Wong. Has received a copy of interim payment application no. 6 (IP No. 6) submitted by the Main Contractor.
	
	The shop drawings, calculation and samples of glass canopy have been approved by the Architect and Structural Engineer. The Main Contractor has applied 20% of work done for the below Bills of Quantities ("B.Q.") Item for "Design, Supply and Installation of Glass Canopy".
	
	![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805124922.png)
	
	Mr. Wong has raised the comments that as there is no work done on site for the glass canopy, the Main Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment for this item.
	
	You are the Project Quantity Surveyor working in a Consulting Quantity Surveying firm for this project. Please draft a written reply (with reference to the relevant Clause(s) of the Conditions of Contract) in response to Mr. Wong's comments on the Main Contractor's submitted IP No. 6.	[3 marks]

- Part B
	The project is now approaching to completion. However, the "as fitted" record drawings and Operation & Maintenance Manuals for Building Services Installations are still outstanding from the Main Contractor. The relevant B.Q. items are extracted as follows: -
	![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805124932.png)
	Mr. Wong called you this morning and requested you to withhold certain amount (say HK $100,000 for each of these 2 items) for these 2 outstanding items from the Main Contractor's submitted interim payment application no. 20 ("IP No. 20").
	
	You are again requested to draft a written reply in response to Mr. Wong's comments on the Main Contractor's submitted IP No. 20. [4 marks]
## Assessor Notes

- A. Payment for design submission
	- The valuation of IP should include the estimated value of work properly executed. This would not be restricted to work completely executed. Work partially executed should be included in the valuation as well (SFBC 32.2). 
	- The design work of the glass canopy has been particularly described as part of MC's duty in the said BQ item. The unit rate for the said BQ item should be deeded to have some allowance for the design work in the absence of other specific items for the design works.
	- The value of design work done should be included in the payment valuation based on a reasonable proportion of BQ rate to be worked out considering the relative costs of design, materials, labour and plant.
- B. Withhold more amount than priced 
	- Where there are contract rates, the contract rates should be used of pricing variation whether it is an addition or an omission, notwithstanding that the actual costs may be much higher or lower than the contract rates. Similarly, the contract rates should be used for payment valuation, even though it is obvious in the present case that the priced amount cannot reflect the actual cost of works, unless there was a special agreement to deal with such unreasonably low rate at the time of tender clarification and contract award.
	- If the Employer wants to deviate from the contract rates, MC may also explore opportunities to deviate from the contract rates, e.g. an item with highly priced rates have been omitted. This would not be desirable.
	- BQ item for provision of O&M manuals has been priced as included. Any monetary cost attributable to this item should be deemed to have been included for elsewhere in the rates for other items. Unless there was a special arrangement to deal with such pricing at the time of tender clarification and contract award, in the case of omission of this item, there is no contract rate to use. A pro-rata rate making reference to similar items may be used. If there is no applicable pro-rata rate, a fair rate based on the reasonable cost to do it should be used for the omission. This reasonable cost may or may not be the same as HK$100,000 as suggested by Employer. The same principle applies to payment valuation.
	- To avoid the intentional insertion of low rates for these close-out items in anticipation of payment deduction, either the rates should be carefully scrutinized at the time of tender award (Gov not allow adjustment) or the items are not to be priced separately such that the amount to be retained for work not yet done could be based on the more reasonable costs.

#Estimate
## Question

Question No. 1 - Cost Estimate

Your firm has been appointed to provide quantity surveying services for a Proposed ABC Residential Development ("the Development"). You are the Project Quantity Surveyor assigned by your firm. Your firm has prepared a cost estimate for the Development. A copy of the Cost Estimate and the associated outline specification is included as Attachment 1 to this Question No. 1. In the last project meeting, the Employer has decided to make certain changes to the building design as outlined in the following table:
  
<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Current Design</td><td>Revised Design</td></tr><tr><td>Residential Lease Gross Floor Area("GFA")</td><td>18,540 m2</td><td>18,540 m2</td></tr><tr><td>Number of towers</td><td>1 tower</td><td>2 identical towers</td></tr><tr><td>Number of residential floors per tower</td><td>35</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Flats per floor</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Number of lifts per tower</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></table></body></html>

Other relevant background information:

1. There will not be any significant change to the basement floors under the Revised Design.
2. The precast facade and window area of the Revised Design will remain the same as that of the Current Design.
3. The Construction Floor Area (herein referred to as "CFA") per typical floor of the Residential Tower will need to be enlarged by 3%
4. The perimeter of each typical floor will need to be increased by 10%

The Employer has requested for a quick update of the Cost Estimate based on the confirmed design changes. Your Director has requested you to: -

(a) identify a list of items in the Cost Estimate that will be affected by the design changes and briefly explain in what ways the elemental costs of the items will be affected; and [12 marks]  

(b) revise the Estimate Summary and Cost Build-up of the Residential Areas by marking on the original copy clearly and legibly. Just say 10% increase to the costs of the Foundations and Pile Caps, and keep the costs of the Basement and G/F Carparks and Plant Rooms, Club House Area on G/F, and External Works and Landscaping Works unchanged for the time being.

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Effect on foundation and pile caps
		- The new design will be more slender than the original design and hence wind effect will become more critical in designing the foundations and the building frame. Therefore, 
			- The foundations will have to be strengthened in the new design
			- The structural carcass in the new design will have to be strengthened which in turn will impose a greater dead load on the foundations
			- And both will be translated into a higher foundation cost
		- An additional cluster of foundations and pile caps will be required due to an additional tower. The formwork to concrete ratio will likely to be increased.
		- The number of tests on piles which may be selected based on a cluster of piles may also be increase
	- Effect on basement construction
		- An additional structure underneath the tower will be added to the basement down to the foundations. The layout of the basement will need to be changed substantially
	- Effect on superstructure
		- Increased CFA
		- Strengthening to compensate for the increased slenderness
		- Increased ratio of structural walls enclosing the lift shafts and staircases to floor are
		- Increased ratio of the more expensive staircases to floor area
	- Effect on facade
		- Increase proportionately as parameter
		- No change to windows, precast facade, and glass railing
	- Effect on roof finishes
		- Increase proportionately as CFA
		- Increase should be slightly more to account for more channels and skirtings per roof area
	- Effect on IFO
		- Increase proportionately as CFA
		- Increase should be slightly more to account for more lift lobbies
	- Effect on E&M
		- Increase proportionately as CFA
		- Increase should be slightly more to account for more services and equipment at the main entrance lobbies, water tank pump rooms and lift machine rooms.
	- Effect on lift
		- Number of lift increase one 
	- Effect on Preliminaries
		- It is acceptable to keep the preliminaries percentage unchanged
	- Clubhouse, external works and landscape
		- Layout of clubhouse may be affect, and the remaining area for landscape will be smaller
		- However, it is acceptable to regard the cost effect as insignificant

## Question

Question No. 2 - Form of Tender

Prior to engaging your Company as the Consultant Quantity Surveyor for a supermall Development, the Employer's in-house staff had prepared a draft Form of Tender (herein referred to as "Draft FoT") (refer to Attachment 1 to this Question No. 2) for the Main Superstructure Contract for the Supermall Development. It is envisaged that tenders will be invited shortly.

The Employer asked if your Company could review and offer comments on the Draft FoT.

Your Senior Associate, Mr. A.B. Wong, left the following Internal Memo on your desk for your action.

- Internal Memo
	Date : 19 September 2012
	
	To : QS Candidate From : A.B.Wong
	
	Main Superstructure Contract for the Supermall Development at 999 Wonder Street, Yuen Long, New Territories
	
	The Employer's Project Manager called and asked if we could review and comment on the attached Draft FoT.
	
	The Project Manager particularly brought to my attention that there would be 2 phases of works, namely the Phase 1 and Phase 2 Works.
	
	Phase 1 Works is as delineated on the tender drawings. Phase 2 Works which is an extension of Phase 1 Works will only commence upon the further decision of the Employer. Similarly, the scope of work and the completion period of Phase 2 Works shall be subject to the final compromise between the Employer and the Architect.
	
	Please identify any error in or problem with this Draft FoT that may expose the Employer to undesirable risks or burden contractually and financially. We need to let the Employer know the reasons why we think so. You may restrict your comments to those provisions presently included in the draft.
	
	An email response would be fine.
	
	Regards, ABW

## Assessor Notes

- Contract name is incorrect
- Phase 1 works 
	- Permitting the tenderers to suggest their own completion periods may enable tenderers to adopt their own best estimates of completion period. However, the suggested completion periods may be too long to be acceptable. It may be necessary to specify the maximum period. Furthermore, different completion periods could affect the tender prices as they would affect the way and duration of the Works are to be planned and carried out. The evaluation of tenders will need to take into account the different cost effects of the different completion periods to the Employer on top of the tender sums.
	- Having uniform completion period would allow the tenderers to price the tenders on a uniform basis and allow comparison of tenders with one less variable. However, if the uniform completion period is unrealistically too long or too short, tenderers may be forced to allow for unnecessary running costs or acceleration costs or even to factor in the damages for delay.
	- The existing clause does not mention start date of the completion period. Depending on the definition given in the Tender Documents, the period may start from the Date of Possession / Commencement / Acceptance of tender.
- Phase 2 works
	- Undefined scope of works and completion period generally increase risks of uncertainty
	- Unable to quote
		- It is not clear whether there are BQ or SOR for tenderers to quote for Phase 2 works. 
		- If no rates are to be quoted, tenderers may price for the risks excessively and unnecessarily or may underprice for the risks. In a competitive tendering, underpricing is more likely to happen.
		- Reasonably priced preliminaries may turn out to be priced too high or too low if the actual scope and time deviate very much from expectations, and if there is no mechanism for reasonable adjustment of such items. Substantial reduction in the scope would also cause under-recovery of overheads and profit.
		- In case of overpricing, the Employer cannot gain back even if the risks turn out to be less.
		- In case of underpricing, the Contractor would try to find grounds to deviate from the quoted rates and prices by arguing that the actual scope and time are different from expectation. The Employer will face more claims.
	- Some tenderers may view the situation as an unbearable uncertainty, and may opt to decline tendering. 
	- Even if the pricing is normal, the uncertainties would be difficult for the Contractor to plan and schedule his works and resources effectively
	- It is not entirely clear whether the extension is time-wise after Phase 1 works or scope-wise at any time during Phase 1 works. If the timing of instructing for Phase 2 works is unfavourable, the Employer may be expose to claims for disruptions, delays to completion, loss an expense.
- Long tender validity period
	- A tender validity period of 12 months is considered as abnormally long.
	- As this is fixed price contract, there is a tendency for tenderers to price for the extra costs due to price fluctuations in the tender.
	- It would be difficult for the tenderers to retain the proposed site staff and sub-contractors for that long period. Extra costs will be required to retain them.
	- The availability of brands and models of materials proposed may also change.
	- The Employer will still need to pay the extra cost built in the tender sum even though the long tender validity period eventually proves to be unnecessary
	- On the other hand, if the Contractor has not allowed sufficient amount to cover price fluctuations and other extra costs, it would affect Contractor's ability to perform and even expose him to bankruptcy.
	- Some tenderers may view the situation as an unbearable uncertainty, and may opt to decline tendering.

## Question

Question No. 3 - Tender Documentation

(a) Please state the reasons for including a Form of Tender in the Tender Documents. [3 marks]

(b) Under what circumstances would a tenderer be required to submit a duplicate of the same Form of Tender and submit more than one version of Form of Tender. [3 marks]

(c) Please state the reasons for requiring a Nominated Sub-Contractor to provide a Form of Warranty to the Employer. [3 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A. reasons for including FOT
	- FOT is intended to provide a uniform format for the tenderers to state their offers, in terms of tender sums and completion period, for the Works that the Employer may wish to be executed
	- FOT lists out the documentary basis of the tender offers, e.g. CC, dwg, spec, BQ / SOR, etc., so as to ensure no future argument over the basis of the tender offers.
	- FOT requires the offeror to state clearly his identity and sign FOT by an authorized signatory
	- FOT states the validity period of the offer, which means that offeree may accept the offer at any time within such period. Any unqualified acceptance of the offer would become a binding contract.
	- Serve functions like:
		- Give opportunity for stating alternative offers in a specified manner
		- Require acknowledgement of SCC, TA, particulars to be inserted in Appendix to CC, and other important contractual terms
		- Require declaration of undertaking to provide bond or warranty in a specified form
		- Require acknowledgement that the offeree is not bound to accept the lowest or any offer 
		- Require information on registered address, business registration certificate number, names of partners in case of a partnership, etc.
- B. duplicate copy for FOT
	- A duplicate copy of FOT may be required to be submitted so that the Employer may keep it for record purposes when the Consultants are keeping the tenders for analysis, or for long term record purposes by another department.
	- Alternative FOT may be required if it is desired to have a separate FOT each capable of being accepted for alternative proposals such as alternative tenders for different SOW / contract period / design proposal from tenderer / fluctuation clause.
- C. form of warranty
	- By nomination arrangement, the Employer still retain some liabilities towards the Contractor if NSC does not perform in some cases. However, the contract only exists between MC and NSC. There is no privity of contract between Employer and NSC. The Employer will have no redress against the NSC if NSC does not perform and the MC is relieved or gets compensated in terms of time or costs.
	- Some NSC also takes up design responsibility which is not within the scope of responsibility of the Contractor who is primarily for build-only. If NSC's design fails, the Employer cannot hold the Contractor primarily liable so that he may pass down the liability to NSC. The chain of responsiblity is therefore broken.
	- To remedy the above situations, NSC will be required to provide, in consideration of Employer's nomination, an agreement collateral to the NSC, a Form of Warranty or alternatively called Form of Collateral Agreement, to guarantee directly to the Employer for the due performance of the NSC, particular, in respect of timely progress, reasonable skill and care in design and selection of materials, satisfaction of performance specification, timely provision of information, with an undertaking to compensate the Employer's loss and expense in case of non-performance and also an undertaking to provide a surety bond in favour of the Employer

## Question

Question No. 4 - Life Cycle Costs

During a recent design meeting, the M&E Consultant introduced an innovative air-conditioning system which, if adopted for the proposed megamall development project, will qualify for extra credit under the Building Environmental Assessment Method ("BEAM") PLUS assessment because there would be savings in energy consumption, reduction of carbon emission, enhancement of the building performance environmentally, etc. The Employer of the project is keen to obtain the BEAM Plus certification on his building as he is interested in quality building performance as well as reducing the environmental impacts of his building throughout its life cycle. He also considered the certification would enhance his image and attract more rental revenue. The Employer asked if your firm (acting as the Project Consulting Quantity Surveyor) could advise him on what kind of costs that he should take into account in order to make an economic evaluation of this innovative air-conditioning system against a normal system. The Employer said that it would not be necessary to provide any costing as the actual design would still to be developed. [7 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- LCC of air-conditioning system can be expressed as following:-
	- ![image.png|350](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805125259.png)
- The capital costs can include:
	- The supply and installation costs of the systems
	-  the costs of different times to supply and install the system
	- The costs of areas and spaces to accommodate the system
	- The costs of the plant rooms and pipe ducts
	- The costs of builder's works and concealing or decorative fitting out works affected
	- The extra design fee in reviewing and including the system into the original building design scheme
	- Capital cost may be reduced because of subsidies or bonuses offered by utility companies or government
- Long term cost included
	- Daily operation cost - labour / technicians manning the system, consumables like power, fuel, water, lubricants, etc., insurances and overhead charges
	- Regular maintenance and repair cost - regular costs incurred at a longer interval
	- Overhaul 翻修 and replacement cost - scheduled overhaul work on and replacement of major component at its end of life, e.g. once in every 5-8 years, and for the sake of comparison of two systems with different life spans, terminal replacement cost at the end of life of the system
	- Disposal costs - demolishing and disposing the whole system at the end of the system
	- Residual value - the possible scrape or re-sale value of the system upon disposal
- Discounted cash flow calculation is to be used to bring costs incurred at different time to the same time for comparison
- The life span of the system is also very important. When two systems have different life spans, the calculation should be based on the same lowest common multiple of years of life spans. However, the possibility of the system becoming obsolete 废弃的 by its end of life and the possibility of a major modification because of a change of the building functional layout before the system's normal life span should also be considered.

#Payment #LAD 
## Question

Question No. 1 - Interim Payment and Liquidated & Ascertained Damages

You are the Consulting Quantity Surveyor appointed by the Employer.

Following the issuance of the Interim Payment Certificate No. A-034, the Architect noticed that your latest financial status report to the Employer was indicating a likely Final Contract Sum of around HK $505 million. If the Employer would continue to pay the Contractor in accordance with the latest interim payment certificate, it may leave the Employer with insufficient balance to make deduction for Liquidated and Ascertained Damages ("LAD") should he wish to impose the LAD.

The Employer would wish you to report the current financial status and whether he might run into the risk of overpaying the Contractor by taking into account the latest project completion status.

The Employer also expressly highlighted that he would want to know the amount of LAD likely deductible.

You are requested by your Associate to work out the amount of LAD deductible and draft a letter in response to the Employer's raised concern.

The Architect has just issued the Certificate of Practical/Substantial Completion and the Dates of Sectional Completion and Practical/Substantial Completion are as follows:-

(a) Phase 1 : 11 March 2012  
(b) Phase 2 : 10 July 2012  
(c) Phase 3 : 10 July 2012

- ![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805125409.png)
- After honouring the present IP, the outstanding payment of $5M exclusive of retention is not sufficient to cover the amount of LAD of $12.4M. However, the retention of $12.5M can cover the short-fall.
- The Employer may deduct the LAD from the payment due when honouring the present or future payment certificate but there are pre-requisite conditions as stated in the Contract that should be observed before deduction for LAD, e.g. non-completion cert, completed all EOT, notice by Employer.
- If the Employer wishes to impose LAD but without the need to offset an equivalent amount from retention, the Certificate of Non-Completion must be issued, if not already issued, before the due date for present payment, subject to the time frames specified in the Contract in connection with the Certificate of Non-Completion.
- Withholding payment as certified without following the provisions in the Contract may constitute a breach of contract. It is a case law that the Employer must pay as certified first and recover the short-fall later.
- Withdrawing and revising the certificate to buy time to complete the necessary procedures may be a solution but this is not entirely free of doubt on the contractual validity
- Employer has to balance between the financial exposure of over-payment and the risk of breaching the Contract
- Whether there could be further EOT and further increase to the anticipated Final Contract Sum should be taken into consideration

#Defect 
## Question

Question No. 3 - Contractual Duties on Rectification Works

Following the heavy rainfall and Typhoon Signal No. 10 two days ago, water leakage was found at the joints of the glass canopy over the central courtyard area of the building. The glass canopy, which was procured under a Nominated Sub-Contract, together with the Main Contract Works, was certified practically/substantially completed by the Architect only two months ago. In the meeting yesterday, the Employer expressed his annoyance and frustration that the Architect went ahead and certified Practical/Substantial Completion despite the fact that the leakage had already occurred before the building was handed over to him. He was also afraid that this would be treated as a patent defect discoverable before completion or regarded as a damage caused by typhoon after Practical/Substantial Completion that the Contractor and Nominated Sub-Contractor would be relieved of liability.

The Employer asked you, being the Consulting QS, whether his understanding was correct and what course of actions he has under the Contract to get the leakage rectified without incurring additional cost. Your Boss would like you to prepare an email to the Employer.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- SC date not necessary the handover date
- The water leakage found before SC might have been rectified and found satisfactory by the time of issuing the SC Cert, and it should be noted that the SC Cert cannot be unreasonably withheld for minor defects.
- Contract may exclude liability for damage caused by typhoons occurring after SC. It should be noted that his refers to damage, not defects. It is usual for the Specification to impose a design or performance liability such that the glass canopy will be able to withstand severe weather conditions which may likely be encountered. Therefore, if the glass canopy cannot withstand the heavy rainfall, MC & NSC have a duty to prove or counter-prove that the cause exceeded the specified performance requirements and the effect amounted to a damage, or to prove that they are not taking up any design or performance liability at all.
- Contractually, the following course of actions may be adopted for the Employer:
	- Carry out a site inspection by the Architect, Contractor and NSC to identify the extent and cause of leakage
	- Ascertain that the leakage is a defect or as a result of other causes for which the Contractor and NSC are not responsible
	- Issue AI to MC and NSC to rectify such defect as cl.17. 
	- Ask MC and NSC to provide a defect rectification proposal with methodology and programme
	- Appoint others to carry out if MC & NSC fail to rectify, and make deduction from payment due
	- Resort to indemnity under Form of Warranty, guarantee or surety bond provided by NSC if NSC fails to perform those responsibilities for which the MC is not responsible, such as design responsibility

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 4 - Valuation of Variation Works

You are the Project Quantity Surveyor of the Contractor for a residential development.

The design and construction of a mock-up flat have been approved by the Architect and the Employer, which is basically the same design as the tender's. An Architect's Instruction has been issued to approve the design of the mock up flat. Subsequent to the approval, all tiles have been ordered by the Contractor.

The approved wall and skirting tiles in the bathroom are:

(a) 300mm x 150mm x 10mm homogenous skirting tiles (herein referred to as "Skirting Tiles")  

(b) 300mm x 200mm x 10mm brown colour homogenous wall tiles (herein referred to as “Brown Colour Tiles")  

(c) no band tiles

Without changing the overall tiled areas in the bathrooms, the Employer is now considering to have the following design revisions to the finishes of the bathrooms (herein referred to as “Intended Design Changes").

(1) Omit the Skirting Tiles.  

(2) Add a 100mm high band in 300mm x 100mm x 10mm homogenous border tiles (herein referred to as “Band Tiles") (by cutting the original Skirting Tiles to required size) just below the window level. Any insufficient Band Tiles will be further ordered.  

(3) Change 8 pieces of Brown Colour Tiles to 300mm x 200mm x 10mm special colour homogenous wall tiles (herein referred to as "Special Colour Tiles") in each bathroom.

As discussed and confirmed in yesterday's site meeting, the originally ordered tiles for use in the bathrooms will be delivered to the Site within 2 weeks and the Contractor will commence the tiling works accordingly. All works in the bathrooms will be completed within the next 3 months. It has been confirmed by the supplier that the delivery time of any new order for Band Tiles and Special Colour Tiles will take 3 months after ordering. The late delivered Band Tiles and Special Colour Tiles will be completed within 1 month after delivery without affecting the overall completion of the whole of the Contract Works.

The Project Director of the Employer, Mr. P D Wong, quoted the below Special Preambles Clause included in Bill No. 2.

"The rate for tile, slab and sheet finishes are to include for laying in colours and patterns as required and approved by the Architect and for all cutting and waste for equal margins."

Mr. P D Wong further said that based on the quoted Special Preambles Clause and the fact that the remaining time before the currently extended date for Completion would still be enough for completing the tiling works in the bathrooms, the cost implication of the Intended Design Changes should be minimal.

A meeting has been arranged tomorrow between Mr. P D Wong and your Boss to discuss the lntended Design Changes. Your Boss considered that the cost implication of the Intended Design Changes should not be minimal as suggested by Mr.P DWong.

You are requested by your Boss to list out the items of omissions and additions and advise on the method of valuation of each item with explanatory notes illustrating your adopted contract provisions, underlying principles, cost factors and considerations

[Notes to Candidates : No calculation is required for answering this question.]

[15 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- The variation can be summarized as follows:
	- Omit skirting tikes
		- Omit skirting tile (m) @ contract rate
		- Add brown colour tiles of the same are (m2) @ contract rate
	- Add band tile
		- Add band tile (m) @ pro-rata from contract rate for skirting tile taking into account of additional cutting cost and wastage, and difference in labour cost laying
		- Omit brown colour tile of the same area (m2) @ contract rate
		- Add extra cost of ordering further band tile (m) @ extra supply rate due to late ordering with allowance for wastage, profit and overheads
		- Add extra cost of laying further ordered band tile (m) @ extra laying cost due to out-of-phase laying with allowance for profit and overheads
	- Change brown colour tile to special colour tiles
		- Add special colour tile (no/m2) @ fair rate taking into account of out-of-phase laying in isolated area
		- Omit brown colour tiles of the same area (m2) @ contract rate
	- Add extra cost of ordering additional brown colour tiles if the final quantity is more than that already ordered (m2) @ extra supply rate due to late ordering with allowance for profit and overheads
	- Add cost of surplus brown colour tiles ordered if the final quantity is less than that already required (m2) @ actual supply rate
	- Add extra cost of setting out
	- Add cost of modifying the mock-up bathroom already done
- Contract provisions for VO & explain
	- VO for omission 
		- Cl.13.4(3), full clause
		- Subject to adjustment for extra cost for late ordering, the contract rate for skirting tiles and brown colour tiles shall determine the valuation of the omission under cl.13.4(3)
	- VO for addition 
		- Cl.13.4(1), full clause
		- Subject to adjustment for extra cost for late ordering & out-of-phase laying, the valuation rule under cl.13.4(1) shall be followed.
		- For brown colour tile, since there is no substantial change of qty or character or conditions, the contract rates shall apply by default
		- Band tiles are a new item and fair rates shall apply by default. Part of band tiles will be cut from the original skirting tiles and part of the band riles will be further ordered and laid later. Two different rates may be applied to these two parts.
		- However, it may be argued that the band tile cut from skirting tiles are quite similar to the skirting tiles such that the rates should be pro-rata from the contract rate for skirting tile with adjustment for additional cutting cost and wastage and different in labour cost laying
		- Those further ordered band tiles will only be laid out-of-phase after completion of all other work in the bathrooms
		- The special colour tiles are also a new item and fair rates shall apply. These tiles are ordered late and will only be laid out-of-phase after the completion of all other work in the bathrooms
		- For band tile and special colour tile laid out-of-phase, the following extra costs should be considered when building-up the pro-rata or fair rates or, if found to be more convenient, separately:
			- Extra cost of further ordering the tiles, plus wastage, profit and overheads
			- Extra marking out to reserve the area for the out-of-phase work
			- Extra labour and internal transportation cost due to more visits or smaller batches of transportation
			- Extra protection of the completed work before laying the further ordered tiles
			- Making good of possible damage caused while laying the further ordered tiles
			- Extra cleaning and removal of debris due to another round of laying
			- Any other extra costs reasonably put forward
	- Special Preambles
		- The Special Preambles clause specified the additional coverage of the rates for tile, slab and sheet finishes to include for laying in colours and patterns as required and approved by Architect and for all cutting and wastage for equal margins.
		- It should however be noted that this should only refer to those colours, patterns, cuttings and waste as required for the original Contract Works. Any additional or changed requirements of colours, patterns, cutting and waste instructed during the progress of the Works shall be treated as a variation under the Contract.
	- Abortive material
		- The net change brown tile will be either an addition or reduction subject to assumption made
		- If the net change in qty is a reduction in surplus ordering, the cost of the surplus ordering should be compensated at the actual supply rate plus profit and overheads (cl.13.4.(3)(b))
	- Abortive works
		- As the tiling work in the bathrooms will be commenced around 2 weeks later, the setting out for tiling work based on original design should have been done to certain extent. If the design changes are adopted, the said completed setting out will be come abortive
		- If design changes are adopted, the completed tiling work in the bathroom of mock-up will also be required to be hacked off and re-laid partially according to the new design. A cost compensation may be permitted, depending on the contract provisions of mock-up.
	- Acceleration and prolongation cost
		- As the works will not be delayed, there is no cost implication of acceleration and prolongation unless reasonable argument.
		- Disruption costs should have been covered by above items

## Question

You are the project quantity surveyor of a QS consultant firm for a new office development project. This project is still in the preliminary design stage. The attached Cost Plan No. 1 has been issued to the Project Manager (PM) a week ago. The Project Manager asked if you could provide the following information for his discussion with the management.

A.	The PM’s management considers that there is insufficient number of car- parking spaces in the current design of the Project and requests the consultant team to study whether adding one additional basement floor of the same foot- print area with a clear head-room of 3.50 m (minimum) (instead of 4.5m) is feasible. Having checked with the Structural Engineer, it was confirmed that the same type of sheet piling is to be adopted but with the depth of the piles extended to twice the excavation depth.

Please advise the PM a rough indication of construction costs for adding the one extra basement floor. All re-design consultancy fees (if any) are to be excluded.

[12 Marks]

B.	The current design of the typical floors of the Project assumes that each floor is to be let to a single tenant where there is no provision of partitioning between the office areas and corridors or any inter-tenancy partitioning. The Marketing Department of the Employer would like to know the approximate fitting out cost for introducing a common corridor around the central core and sub-dividing the office areas on all 30 typical floors to facilitate multiple tenancies. A preliminary layout for estimating purpose is attached to this Question. Please advise the  PM a rough indication of fitting out cost (building services fitting out cost is to be excluded for this estimate). All re-design consultancy fees (if any) are to be excluded.

[5 Marks]

C.   Revise  the cost plan summary  sheet  incorporating  the revisions  for  items (a) and (b).

#TenderDoc #LAD 
## Question

A. You are the project quantity surveyor of a QS consultant firm and are preparing the tender documents for the foundations works for an office development in East Kowloon which is scheduled to call for tenders in the next month.

Since the programme of this office development is very tight and it is vital that the development should be completed timely, the Employer suggested to include the following clauses in the forthcoming foundations tender, but would like to have your advice on whether such clauses are enforceable and whether there would be rooms for argument. Please write an email to advise the Employer.

- SCC Clause 1 -	Bonus for early completion
	- The Employer shall pay as a bonus to the Contractor a sum of $50,000 for each calendar day preceding the contract or extended Date <alternatively: the contract Date only>* up to a limit of $1,500,000 for Completion that the Works are certified by the Architect to have been substantially completed.
- SCC Clause 2 - Liquidated damage for non-completion
	- The rate of liquidated damages for delayed completion beyond the contract or extended Date for Completion shall be $100,000 per day for the first 14 calendar days of delay and $250,000 per day for any further days of delay.

\* your advice should cover, among other issues, the effect of such alternative wording.

[8 Marks]

B. At the same time, you are about to prepare the tender documents for a minor contract namely CCTV Drain Survey which involves a survey of the underground drain pipes for submission to the Drainage Services Department. The cost for this Survey package is approximately $80,000.

The Employer is thinking about NOT including any liquidated  and ascertained damage (LAD) clause in the tender in view of the small scale of the survey works and also of the fact that the works would be completed within a very short period of time. The Employer asks whether it is contractually acceptable  in  excluding  a LAD clause in a contract  and whether it will deprive his right from recovering damages in the event that the Drain Survey is delayed to an  extent  that  affects  the  overall  completion  of  the whole Project.

Write a letter to the Employer advising him the contractual implications, in particular the remedy for delay, if a LAD clause is not included in the contract.

[7 Marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Bonus payment for early completion
	- The Employer is free to include a bonus clause in the Contract for early completion of the Works. The bonus scheme does not have to match the amount of LAD.
	- Whether the early completion refers to the contract Date for Completion or extended Date for Completion would need careful consideration.
		- If the early completion refers to the contract Date for Completion only, it would mean that if the Substantial Completion is achieved before the extended Date for Completion but after the contract Date for Completion, no bonus will be awarded. This would mean that a delay caused by Employer would reduce Contractor's opportunity to recap the bonus, and the Contractor would need to spend extra effort and costs to catch up more than the Employer's delay before he can reap the bonus. The Employer would benefit from his own fault first. The Contractor may argue that this is unfair and would seek to refer to the extended Date for Completion as the benchmark for early completion. The special condition should be elaborated further to expressly state the Employer's intention beyond doubt. However, the Contractor may not have real incentive to complete early once the Employer delays the Works.
		- If the early completion refers to the extended Date for Completion only, the SCC should be elaborated further to expressly state whether the bonus if on top of or inclusive of the loss and expense compensation for those EOT entitling financial compensation. 
- Sliding scale of LAD
	- LAD is a sum agreed by Employer and Contractor in advance as the amount to be paid by the Contractor as damages if Contractor breaches the Contract by failing to complete the Works on time.
	- For a LAD provision to be enforceable, the rate fixed should represent a genuine pre-estimate, judged at the time the Contract is entered into, of the likely loss which may arise if the Works are delayed, and would be applied to the period of delay, without the need to prove the actual loss and irrespective of any deviations between the pre-estimate and the actual loss. 
	- However, a LAD provision will not be enforced even if the Contract is agreed and signed if the rate fixed is more than the genuine pre-estimate and constitutes an improper penalty. If the rate fixed is found to be "extravagant or unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss which could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach", it will be held to be a penalty. LAD is compensatory, not punitive. It cannot be arbitrary and must relate to the consequence of late completion.
	- The proposed LAD provision if different from the usual LAD provision because it provides for a sliding scale of LAD rates instead of a uniform LAD rate. The daily rate of LAD will be increased form $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day after the first 14 days of delay. Such drastic increase could be perceived as a deterrent and therefore a penalty. It is therefore of prime importance to document the principle or basis of how the sliding scale of LAD was fixed. If the sliding scale is consistent with the genuine pre-estimated loss pattern for the delay, the provision is enforceable. Otherwise, the provision may amount to an unenforceable penalty clause. It may stand the challenge if $250,000 per day was in fact a genuine pre-estimate and $100,000 per day was purposely made lower. It may stand if after a certain date, a special event would occur that the genuine pre-estimated loss would increase drastically. However, the date should likely be a fixed calendar rather than relating to the contract or extended Date for Completion both of which Dates are generally floating at the time of tendering to permit the pre-estimate genuine to use 14 calendar days after them as the triggering date.
- Not include LAD
	- If the Employer does not include a LAD clause in the Contract at all, the Employer may seek recovery of general / actual damages for a delay caused by Contractor but the Employer has the legal burden to prove his actual loss and expense caused by the delay with detailed substantiation and documentation, which may not be easy especially when proving and isolating the cause and effect relationship from other concurrent items.
	- Should the parties have dispute over the determination of damages, costly and time consuming legal proceedings are generally inevitable.
	- From the tenderer's point of view, the absence of LAD will pose uncertainty in his risk exposure in case the project is delayed by him. If the actual damages are related to the whole project, the amount could well exceed his tender sum. He would not tender for the Contract.
	- Facing the impracticability to put high rate of LAD or alternatively seek general damages, the possible alternative measures would be to commission the Drain Survey as early as possible, or include it in the major contract for the more capable one to bear the risk, or consider constructing new drains.

#CashFlow 
## Question

- A. Cash Flow Protection
	
	You are a quantity surveyor working in the Cost Control Department of a local property developer. In your absence, as requested by your senior, your assistant QS prepared a cash flow projection in accordance with the following information and the in-house standing instruction that all projects should adopt the company’s “Standard Rate of Expenditure for Construction Projects” for cash flow projection. He passed it directly to your senior. When you came back to the office, your senior called you to discuss the matter.
	
	Draft a memo to respond to the following questions raised during the discussion:-
	
	(1)	The amount of the cumulative certified payment at the end of: 
		(i)	the 5th month [2 Marks]
		(ii)	the 15th month [2 Marks]
	should be reviewed and what would be the reasonable amounts to be expected for a contract of this nature at that time?
	
	(2)	Generally, the cash flow projection looks too rapid and too smooth when compared with other cash flow projections of similar projects which are also based on the “Standard Rate of Expenditure for Construction Projects". Please sketch a graph (without the need to include exact figures) on the graph paper titled “Graph Paper for Answering Question 3(a)(2)” which is attached at the end of this paper to illustrate modifications required and explain the reasons for the modifications? [2 Marks]

- B. Feasibility Study
	Further to the above, your senior would like you to explain the following issues in relation to cash flow projection to your assistant:
	
	(1) The purposes and importance of a project cash flow projection from the perspective of a property developer. [2 Marks]
	
	(2) Already knowing the total estimated construction cost, how the cash flow would affect the total budget, and what would a common method used to evaluate the relative merits of different cash flow patterns be? [2 Marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A(1)
	- The foundation contract sum is $20M, the cumulative certified payment at the end of 5th month should not be greater than that. Retention has not been taken into account in the cash flow projection. A moiety of retention should be withheld and released after DLP. The amount should be $19.5M
	- Retention has not been taken into account in the cash flow projection. A moiety of retention should be withheld and will be released after DLP. The amount should be $146.75M.
	- It is probable that the certification of the first moiety would happen in the month following Substantial Completion
- A(2)
	- The cash flow projection looks to rapid and smooth due to two reasons.
	- Firstly, retention has not been taken into account in the cash flow projection. According to the information provided, 10% retention with a limit of 5% of the total will be withheld during progress payments. A moiety of retention will be released upon SC and another moiety will be released after DLP. Without taking into account the retention, the amount of the cumulative certified payment in the early stages of the project will be larger and therefore the cash flow projection becomes quicker.
	- Secondly, the cash flow projection was prepared based on the total contract sum of foundations and MC. The cash flow patterns for the foundations contract and MC should be very different and thus the pattern based on the combined total could not reflect this situation. The original cash flow projection therefore looks too smooth.
	- ![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805130000.png)
- B(1)
	- Cash flow projection shows how cash is expected to flow in and out of a project. It is an important tool for cash flow management, letting the property developer know when he needs to pay for contractors in order to make proper financial arrangement on time. Projects with external stakeholders such as banks may require a regular forecast. Certainly, if the project has a bank loan, the bank would want to look at the cash flow forecast at regular intervals. Cash flow is the life-blood of all projects. It is essential to have an accurate cash flow projection to make sure the project has enough money to carry on.
	- Moreover, it provides essential information for the developer to analyze the time value of money in feasbility study and capital budgeting to apprise long-term project
- B(2)
	- Although the total estimated construction cost is known, since the expenditure would occur at different times, and would affect different interest rates for different periods. It would be necessary to calculate the financing charges. The cash flow projection would form the basis for such calculations. Furthermore, discounted cash flow calculations would be used to evaluate the relative merits of different cash flow patterns.

#BuildTech 
## Question

You are the Consultant Quantity Surveyor appointed by an inexperienced local property developer for a luxury residential building in the mid-level. The Employer was invited to attend a BIM awards presentation ceremony recently. The Employer understands that the Housing Authority and MTR Corporation and a few of the large local property developers have started using BIM in their projects. One of the awards winning case titled “BIM for Efficient Design and Quantitative Estimating" which inspired the Employer that BIM will be helpful for many aspects including projects cost control. Therefore, during one of the design meetings, the Employer raised the following questions to you.

i)	What is Building Information Modeling?

ii)	What are the major applications of BIM in quantity surveying and project cost control?

iii)	What are the current obstacles to promoting the use of BIM?

The Employer would like to have your advice in a letter.

[5 Marks]

## Assessor Notes

- What is BIM?
	- "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the process of generating and managing building data during its life cycle. Typically it uses three-dimensional, real-time, dynamic building modeling software to increase productivity in building design and construction. The process produces the BIM, which encompasses building geometry, spatial relationships, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components." - HKIBIM
- Major application 
	- In Quantity surveying and project cost control
		- Produce SOR automatically
		- Enhance accuracy and speed of quantity taking off  
		- Automatically accommodate changes of design to quantity taking off and SOR
		- Thus, facilitate QS's tasks including cost estimate, cost study, BQ preparation, IP valuation, estimate and valuation of variations, final account
- Current obstacles of application
	- Lack of surplus fund to procure BIM software and supporting hardware
	- Lack of experienced users
	- Lack of training of new users and high off-job and on-job training costs
	- Potential users too busy to spare time to learn and practice
	- Software not mature enough to meet QS's need
	- Years and amount of return on investment not certain
	- Design consultants not using BIM yet
	- Efficient and effective mode of transfer or collaboration of models between different consultants not established yet
	- All consultants are used to work alone

#Payment 
## Question

Question No. 1 – Interim Payment

You are the consultant project quantity surveyor of a residential building project.

(a) Based on the contract particulars given below, please write a note to your new assistant QS, Peter, to point out the errors in the draft summary of Interim Payment Valuation No. 15 at the attached Appendix A prepared by him.

[4 marks]

(b) The Employer’s PM, Mr. S Wong just call you and said the Contractor had called him and asked for help in easing cash flow by paying the deposit for kitchen cabinets. Mr. Wong understands that there is no material-off-site payment clause in the Contract and he is not contractually bound to pay the deposit. However, he would like to maintain a partnering relationship with the Contractor and asked you to analyze the risks and considerations, from the Employer’s point of view, of help paying the deposit.

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Retention should not exceed limit of retention
	- Based on SFBC, L&E and fluctuation not subject to retention
- B
	- By paying the deposit for kitchen cabinets, Employer will effectively be making an advance payment or over-payment to the Contractor without actual materials or work on site as security. It would expense the Employer to higher financial risk if the Contractor eventually does not perform. However, if the cash flow problem is real, without help, the chances of the Contractor not performing will be increased.
	- Probably, the first thing to do is to review whether there has been unreasonable shortfall in payment to the Contractor. Rectification of the shortfall may resolve the problem.
	- If this is not enough, the likelihood of the Contractor eventually not performing will need to be considered taking into account the following factors:
		- Whether the progress of the Contractor has been good
		- Whether the Contractor's track record of good performance has been good
		- Whether the financial difficulty is one-off or persisting showing signs of financial instability
		- Whether the forthcoming progress will be adequate to make up the temporary overpayment
		- Whether there is a bond given by Contractor and the bond is of adequate buffer to cover possible over-payment 
	- If the Contractor is considered to be trustworthy, advance payment can be effected, possibly without going into the details of the payment arrangement between the Contractor and the kitchen cabinet people. The method of recovering the advance payment in future needs to be agreed.
	- If the sign of the Contractor not performing is very strong, perhaps tighter control will in fact be the only choice.
	- If the financial difficulty is temporary, helping the Contractor will be better to ensure the survival of him and the Contract, but some security measures may need to be considered.
	- Possible risk mitigation measures could be:
		- Requesting for an increase in the level of bond, e.g. increasing the existing bond amount, requiring an advance payment bond, requiring a personal guarantee. However, the chances may be low because if the Contractor can arrange for any of these, he may not need to request for help.
		- Dealing directly with the kitchen cabinet people by way of a direct contract but not relieving the Contractor from his original responsibility due to such an arrangement - paying through the Contractor to kitchen cabinet people will not create any contractual obligation upon them towards the Employer. The kitchen cabinet people may be required to give some undertaking towards the Employer in consideration of the indirect payment arrangement. However, in case of bankruptcy of the Contractor, it is doubtful whether the Employer can have any priority over other creditors in respect of such undertakings. Dealing directly with the kitchen cabinet people will ensure that if the Contractor eventually does not perform, the kitchen cabinet people will still be responsible to the Employer, but may have a drawback that the Contractor may argue to be relieved over the future performance of the kitchen cabinet people.

#EOT #LossExpense #Determination 
## Question

Question No. 2 – Care of the Works

You are the project quantity surveyor of the Contractor for the construction of a residential building. Four months ago, a fire took place in that building, when it was near the topping out of its reinforced concrete structure, causing substantial damage and delay to the project.

Your company has procured a “Contractor’s All Risks” insurance containing the usual terms. While the loss adjuster has taken a very detailed investigation, it remains uncertain whether the fire was caused by the default of the Employer, the default of your company or otherwise.

Your boss asked you to give advice, quoting relevant contract clauses, on the matters listed in (a) to (d) below for each of the following scenarios:

Scenario A – The fire was caused by the default of your company;  
Scenario B – The fire was caused by the default of the Employer; and  
Scenario C – The fire was NOT caused by the default of the Employer or your company.  

"the Employer" or "your company" in the above scenarios would include persons for whom each of them is responsible for.

Matters to be addressed:

(a) Whether your company is entitled to an extension of time for the completion of the Works. [3 Marks]  

(b) Whether your company is entitled to recover from the Employer the additional expenditure incurred during the prolonged construction period. [3 Marks]  

(c) Whether your company is entitled to determine its employment under the Contract on the ground of the substantial delay which would probably exceed 120 days. [3 Marks]  

(d) Whether your company is liable for the cost of restoring the damage caused by the fire. [6 Marks]

## Assessor Notes

- EOT
	- Fire is one of the Specified Perils as defined in clause 1. Based on clause 25.1(3)(e), loss or damage caused by Specified Peril is a listed event entitling Contractor to EOT. It appears that this would apply to all three scenarios.
	- However, clause 25.4 stipulates that if the listed event is contributed to, or aggravated by a breach of contract or other default by Contractor or any person for whom the Contractor is responsible, the Architect shall take the effects of the contribution or aggravation into account in fixing the new Completion Date. The Contractor is to take care of the Works under clause 2.1 and negligence is a kind of default. This would apply to Scenario A.
	- As an alternative to clause 25.1(3)(e), if the clause is due to any neglect or default of the Architect, the Employer or any person for whom the Architect or the Employer is responsible, it can be classified as an excepted risk under clause 1 giving EOT entitlement under clause 25.1(3)(d). Furthermore, with some overlaps, if the clause is due to an act of prevention, a breach of contract or other default by Employer or any person for whom the Employer is responsible, it can give EOT entitlement under clause 25.1(3)(v). This would apply to Scenario B.
	- A - no EOT
	- B - EOT
	- C - EOT
- L&E for prolongation
	- While loss or damage caused by a Specified Peril is a listed event for EOT, Specified Peril is not given as a qualifying event for L&E under clause 27.1(2). This would apply to Scenario A and C.
	- For Scenario B, the Contractor is entitled to L&E under clause 27.2(2)(l) which provides for "any other delay or prevention or a breach of contract"
	- Although an excepted risk is given as a listed event for EOT but not a qualifying event for L&E, clause 27.1(2)(l) is wide enough to serve the purpose. If this is considered not to be the case, then by clause 2.1(1)(h), an excepted risk will relieve the Contractor from responsibility for taking care of the Works. Whether the Contractor should remain responsible for the L&E arising from an excepted risk would be an arguable point. 
	- A - no L&E
	- B - L&E
	- C - no L&E
- Right to determination
	- Although the fire will probably result in delay exceeding 120 days, this would not entitle the Contractor to determine his employment under cl.36. Clause 36.1(1)(e) only refers to suspension specifically instructed by Architect under clause 23.3 and has no application in any of the three scenarios.
- Cost of restoring the damage
	- By clause 2.1(1)(h), the Contractor shall take responsibility for the care of the Works except for L&E arising from the excepted risks. This appears to cover Scenarios A and C and only excludes Scenario B from the Contractor's liability.
	- By clause 22.6, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment in respect of the restoration of the damage other than the insurance compensation, unless the loss or damage was caused or contributed to by a breach of contract or other default by the Employer or any person for whom the Employer is responsible. This latter part only excludes Scenario B from the Contractor's liability.
	- By clause 22.7, the effecting of the insurance is without prejudice to clause 2.1.
	- Three clauses combined would still mean that the Contractor is liable under Scenarios A & C.
	- A possible argument would be by way of clause 20(b), where the Contractor shall be liable for injury or damage to real or personal property to the extent that the injury or damage is due to a breach of contract or other default of the Contractor or any person for whom the Contractor is responsible. This clause does not exclude "the Works". If this clause is interpreted a a qualification of clause 2.1(1)(h), then Contractor would be liable under Scenario A only. If this clause is interpreted as a supplement to clause 2.1(1)(h), then the Contractor would still be liable under Scenarios A & C. 
	- It is an implied term of contract that a contractor undertaking to carry out and complete the Works must make good any damage to the Works occurring before completion unless the damage is so great leading to frustration or the damage was caused by the Employer's default
	- In the absence of express provisions contrary to the implied term, it would be reasonable to take clause 2.1(1)(h) as the overriding clause not affected by clause 20(b).
	- The above would mean that
		- Scenario A&C: borne by Contractor unless compensated by insurance
		- Scenario B: falls into the scope of excepted risks or clause 22.6. Borne by Employer only to the extent beyond the scope of insurance. Contractor is responsible to Employer for Contractor's failure to insure.

#Procurement 
## Question

You are the project quantity surveyor of the Contractor for the construction of a private hospital. You have just received a quotation from a supplier for the supply of tiles with the following terms and conditions:

- Terms and conditions
	(a) Title and Delivery
	
	Title to the goods remains with the Supplier until the goods are paid in full. Risk of loss of or damage to the goods passes to the Buyer upon delivery to the Buyer.
	
	(b) Payment Terms
	
	Terms are Cash-On-Delivery. Overdue accounts are subject to interest charges of 1.5% per month.
	
	(c) Delays
	
	The Supplier shall not be liable for delay of delivery caused by happenings or occurrences due to force majeure or any cause beyond the Supplier’s control.
	
	(d) Warranty
	
	Any goods sold or provided by the Supplier shall be deemed accepted by the Buyer upon delivery. Claims for damage, shortage or errors in delivery must be recorded on the original receiving documents and reported within twenty-four hours following delivery to the Buyer.
	
	The Supplier warrants only to the Buyer, and to no other person, that the goods supplied will meet the terms of the Sales Order pursuant to which such goods are sold for a period of twelve months from the date of delivery.
	
	(e) Prices
	
	The prices for the goods are only applicable to the quantities stated in the Quotation. If the Buyer requests for any alterations in the specification or quantity of the goods, the Supplier is entitled to vary the price should the Supplier choose to accept such alterations. All tile sizes stated are nominal sizes. Sizes and prices include recommended joint allowances but exclude cutting and other wastages.

Your senior would like to know in what aspects the terms of the Main Contract are not put through to this Supply Contract. You are requested to identify the “gaps” between the Contractor’s obligations under the Main Contract and the Supplier’s obligations under the Supply Contract in respect of items (a) to (e).

[2 Marks for each items (a) to (e)]

## Assessor Notes

- Title and delivery
	- MC often requires the title to materials delivered to site shall pass to the Employer upon delivery even without payment, and forbid the Contractor to remove the materials from site without consent. The Supplier's terms retain the title until the goods are paid in full. There will be a conflict of title if the Contractor eventually does not pay the Supplier.
	- The Supplier's term regarding retention of title is not unreasonable. However, if the materials are fixed, the Supplier can only claim against the Contractor for damages. If the materials are still unfixed, the Supplier may try to take back the materials, but his chance of success would be slim since the site is in Contractor's control.
	- The passing of the risk of loss or damage upon delivery is reasonable
- Payment term
	- Under MC, payment to Contractor for materials will only be made after the materials are delivered to site, their value included in payment certificates which are not issued immediately but at regular intervals, and the certificates honored for payment. This will take a long time after material delivery. Furthermore, the payment is subject to retention. Since the Supplier requires cash-on-delivery payment, the Contractor will have to pay the Supplier before he is paid by Employer much later.
	- The Contractor should negotiate for grace period for payment and a lower rate of interest.
- Delays
	- MC often puts the risk of delay in delivery of materials to site onto the Contractor, even for force majeure cases and cases due to any cause beyond Contractor's control. Supplier's term also puts the risks of delay to the Contractor.
	- Earlier ordering and delivery by batches would be some solutions to reduce the risks. Suppliers of good track record would also be important.
- Warranty
	- Supplier's term regarding acceptance upon delivery would mean that the Contractor will have to take up the risks if he fails to discover any quality problems upon delivery.
	- It is practically impossible to open all packing for inspection upon delivery. It is usually agreed that the so-called "acceptance" upon delivery is based on the number of unopened packages, or based on external visual inspection only of opened samples for obvious damage, shortage or errors, while quality problems which cannot be revealed by such inspection are still Supplier's responsiblity.
	- The Contractor's liability under MC for the quality of materials would last until the end of the DLP for patent defects, until the end of the statutory limitation period for latent defects, and until the end of any special warranty period specifically required. The Supplier's warranty period of 12 months after delivery is obviously too short.
	- For special materials, MC may require a warranty to be provided by Supplier directly or jointly with the Contractor to the Employer or future owners. The Supplier's term of providing warranty to the Contractor only and to no other person would not be acceptable to the Employer. This would render the Supplier not acceptable.
- Prices
	- The rates in MC are usually fixed and binding upon the Contractor for valuation of variations whereas the price given in the Quotation is only applicable for the qty stated therein. The Contractor has to absorb the cost effect of any changes in the supply rates if the qty are varied, unless he has already allowed for it.
	- The rates in MC are priced based on the net area of the tiling as fixed in place. The rates given in Quotation cover recommended joint allowances but excludes allowance for cutting and wastage. When converting the supply rates to counter-check the budgetary allowance in the supply and fix rates in MC, adjustments should be made or cutting the wastage.

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 4 – Valuation of Variations

You are the consultant project quantity surveyor of a residential development which has been tendered and awarded based on a lump sum (without quantities) contract.

During yesterday’s monthly financial meeting, the Project Director, Mr. E Chan, of the Employer raised his concerns about the following cost claims submitted by the Contractor.

- (a) Cost Claim for Lighting for Hoardings
	The details of the lighting arrangement for the hoardings were confirmed by the Employer and covered by an Architect’s instruction shortly after the commencement of the Works.
	
	The Contractor submitted that no scheme of hoarding lightings was shown on the Contract Drawings and therefore the lighting arrangement covered by the Architect’s instruction should constitute a variation addition under the Contract. However, Mr. E Chan considered that though there was no scheme of hoarding lighting shown on the drawings, the pricing in Schedule No. 1 for hoardings, etc. Against Specification Preliminaries clause 14.15 (see Extract below) should have included for the cost of the hoarding lightings as instructed by the Architect.

- (b) Cost Claim for Modification of Hoardings
	To suit statutory requirements, one more manhole close to the existing hoardings was added. The said work was covered by an Architect’s instruction shortly after the commencement of the Works. In order to suit the site construction, the hoardings close to the newly added manhole had to be modified accordingly.
	
	The Contractor submitted that the modification of the hoardings, resulted from the newly added manhole, should constitute a variation under the Contract. However, Mr. E Chan considered that the pricing in Schedule No. 1 for hoardings, etc. Against Specification Preliminaries clause 14.15 (see Extract below) should have included for the cost of the said modification of the hoardings.

- Extract from the Specification Preliminaries
	14.15 Hoardings, Fencings and Covered Walkways
	
	(i) The Contractor shall construct hoardings as shown on the Drawings. In addition, the Contractor shall take over, make good and adapt any existing hoardings, fencings, covered walkways, gantries and the like left by the previous contractors. The Contractor shall also provide any necessary lighting provisions to the hoardings, whether they are erected or adapted by the Contractor, as directed by the Architect.  
	
	(ii) The Contractor is required to modify the hoardings, etc. In accordance with the Drawings and paint / write the logo and graphics as directed by the Architect. 
	 
	(iii) The Contractor shall maintain the hoardings, etc. Including carrying out any necessary modification, extension, new erection and adaptation to suit the actual site construction during the course of this Contract.

- (c) Omission of Flat Number Signs
	Flat number signs were not shown on the Drawings and Specification of the Contract. Due to unknown reason, they were measured in item 5.7/5/A of the Schedule of Quantities and Rates. Shortly after the commencement of the Works, the Employer in a meeting with the Contractor recalled that the Flat Number Signs should be done by the fitting out direct contractor as stipulated in the Contract. The Employer would wish the Architect to issue an instruction to omit item 5.7/5/A of the Schedule of Quantities and Rates.
	
	The Contractor protested that there should be no cost implication under the Contract. However, Mr. E Chan considered that the price for item 5.7/5/A of the Schedule of Quantities and Rates for the flat number signs should be omitted.

Mr. E Chan would like you to advise on the validity and entitlement of the Contractor’s above cost claims. Please draft a written reply to express your views with the support of contract provisions. [13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Based on cl.5.1(3) of SFBC 2006, qty shall not form part of the Contract but rates shall form part of the Contract.
- A
	- SP states that the Contractor is required, inter alia 除其他事项外, to provide any necessary hoarding lighting as directed by Architect. SP are a part of the Contract Specification. Provision of hoarding lighting have therefore been described in Specification and should be part of the original Contract Works even though the details of the lighting scheme have not been shown on the Contract Drawings but are to be as directed by Architect.
	- The only argument that the Contractor may have is that the provision of hoarding lighting actually directed by Architect is more extravagant than those reasonably anticipated by Contractor when tendering. What would be reasonable would probably need to make reference to other projects and the relevant statutory requirements.
- B
	- The correct interpretation of SP should be that the Contractor is required to include for any necessary modification of the hoardings, etc. To suit the actual site condition only to the extent which may be encountered for the original scope of the Works under the Contract. If additional modification of the hoardings is caused by variations not directly on the hoardings, the additional modification should still be treated as part of the variation.
- C
	- This is a lump sum without qty contract where the qty in SOR shall not form part of the Contract, and any errors in such qty shall be at the Contractor's own risk or benefit. As the flat number signs were not shown on the Contract Drawings or described in the Contract Specification, they are not included in the original Works under the Contract, even though they have been measured and priced in SOR. Therefore, the Architect's instruction attempting to omit them has nothing to omit and has no cost implication

## Question

Question No. 1 – Cost Estimate

Venus Ltd. Is the Owner of Sunny Serviced Apartments (“SSA”) at Tsim Sha Tsui.

Since SSA was built 20 years ago, it is the first time that major renovation works are to be carried out to SSA.

During the project meeting yesterday, Venus requested the design consultant team to review whether it would be feasible to incorporate the following additional work as part of the renovation works:
- a. Adding an additional passenger lift travelling between G/F and 2/F of the podium; 
- b. Upgrading the podium facades by replacing all existing wall tiles (approximate facade area 1,000 m2); and  
- c. Upgrading the interior of all existing 150 no. Apartment units (100 no. Studio units, 40 no. 1-bedroom suites and 10 no. 2-bedroom suites).

Venus is particularly interested in knowing the rough indication of costs of the additional work.

The Architect has confirmed that it is technically feasible to carry out the additional work without the need for major MEP equipment upgrading and foundation modification.

As per Venus’ requirement, the serviced apartments and all common areas will still be in operation during the course of the renovation works.

You are the Project QS of the QS consultant in charge of the renovation works and you have just received the email below from Venus’ financial controller. Please respond to his request.

- Email
	Dear Project QS,
	
	- a. Additional passenger lift and 
	
	- b. Upgrading the podium facade by replacing the existing external wall tiles
	
	Please find attached draft cost estimates prepared by our project coordinator for your comment. Feel free to point out any potential deficiencies in the draft estimates of items (a) and (b). Please also provide your cost estimate of item (b).
	
	- c. Upgrading of the interior of all existing 150 no. Apartment units (100 no.  
	Studio units, 40 no. 1-bedroom suites and 10 no. 2-bedroom suites).
	
	Please use the fitting out costs of a new-build serviced apartment (also owned by our company) in the same district as the base because we would like to negotiate with the same Contractor to carry out the renovation works of the apartment units. Attached are the elemental costs analysed from the fitting out contract for that serviced apartment. That serviced apartment has 100 no. 1-bedroom suites. The size, layout and fitting out standard of the 1-bedroom unit are the same as those in SSA. The fitting out contract was tendered 3 years ago.
	
	I also attach the floor plan of each room type of SSA for your reference. The Architect has advised that the associated building services installation and their ancillary builder’s works are being investigated and are not required to be included in the cost estimate at this stage.
	
	Please provide your cost estimate of item (c). I also need to know the renovation cost per room type for my financial modelling.
	
	Please prepare your reply for discussion later today. 
	Regards,
	
	Donny Chan 
	Financial Controller

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Only the cost of the lift has been included. The associated builder's works and M&E works can be quite costly and not considered in the draft estimate. The following items should be considered:
		- Location of the additional lift
		- Lift type / specification - machine roomless lift or hydraulic lift, glass lift, capacity, speed, etc.
		- Structural scope - demolition, strengthening, lift shaft, lift pit, machine room, etc.
		- IFO - lift interior and lift lobbies, adjacent layout, fire compartmentation, means of escape
		- MEP scope
		- Working hours
		- Extent of hoarding protection
- B
	- Missing allowance for hacking off existing, scaffolding, protection, which could not be absorbed in the normal preliminaries percentage
	- External wall tile are should be net after deducting windows / glass wall. It would be acceptable with assumptions made for deduction of 30-50% of the total area. Rough qty take-off from dwg or site measurement should be mentioned as a next step
	- Allowance for surface preparation including cement screeding and waterproofing are missing
	- Supply and installation rate is too low for wastage, special edge tiles, joints, installation, profit and overheads.
	- Should be around 1-2M
	- A list of assumptions, exclusions and items for clarification is required
	- Items for clarification should include
		- Wall tile specification
		- Survey on existing substrate condition may be required to estimate the extent of preparation work
		- Extent of scaffolding and protection
- C
	- Differences
		- Scope differences, require demolition of existing
		- Quantity differences, ratios derived from approximate measurement
		- Price level differences, due to different times and conditions of working
		- Price level differences, due to different contractual arrangement and Contractor's negotiation power, single contractor negotiation in this case
	- A list of assumptions, exclusions and items for clarification is required

#Insurance 
## Question

Question No. 4 – Insurances

You are the Consultant QS for a residential building project. The tender documents for the Superstructure Main Contract is scheduled to be issued to the tenderers by the end of the coming month and you have just submitted a draft of the front parts of the tender documents to the Project Manager for comment.

It comes to the Project Manager’s attention that the Contractors’ All Risks Insurance of the Works and the Third Party Liability Insurance to be procured by the Contractor as required by your proposed front parts are for different Periods of Insurance. The former is to last till 14 days after Substantial Completion while the latter is to last till the issuance of the Defects Rectification Certificate.

The Project Manager doubted if such a variance in the required Periods of Insurances is appropriate. He is thinking of extending the Period of Insurance of the Contractors’ All Risks Insurance of the Works to cover the entire Defects Liability Period.

You are required to draft a letter to advise the Project Manager in this connection.

[5 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Upon SC, Contractor is obliged to hand over the Works to Employer. Once handed over, the Contractor's responsibility for the care of the Works ceases. There will be no insurable interest for the Contractor to take out an insurance for the Works after handover. Therefore, CAR after SC should only last for a short period of 14 days.
- Employer should take out a Property Liability insurance upon taking over the property from the Contractor.
- After SC, the Contractor would still need to carry out defects rectification works or outstanding works during DLP and such activities may have the risk of causing third party property loss or damage or personal death or injury. Therefore, the Third Party Liability Insurance would need to be continued to cover the entire DLP.
- Other: care of works, extra allowance in tender

## Question

Question No. 1 – Prolongation Claim

You are the Project Quantity Surveyor of the Contractor for a residential building project. The project has been delayed by a month due to a substantial variation ordered by the Architect. Your commercial manager Peter is preparing a submission claiming for additional payment due to prolongation of the time for completion of the Works. While you were on leave, Peter asked your assistant Mary to prepare the calculation based on some formulas and outline the basis of one of the heads of claims, namely head office overheads (excluding net profit) for incorporation into his submission.

The formula used is:

Contract Sum x (Period of Prolongation / Contract Period) x Head Office Overheads percentage

On your return to the office, Peter requests you to supplement Mary’s input with the following:

(a) A concise narrative of the basis of claim for reimbursement of head office overheads due to prolongation of the time for completion of the Works.  

(b) An advice on how the head office overheads percentage should be calculated, and what items may possibly need to be excluded.  

(c) An advice on whether the full Contract Sum can be used in the formula.  

(d) An advice, if the formula approach is not rejected, on what and how documentary proof should be provided to support the percentage while keeping the company’s business and staff’s personal secrets confidential.  

(e) An advice on what adjustment has to be made to the sum yielded by the formula in order to avoid double recovery of head office overheads?

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Basis of claim
	- Loss of opportunity
		- The Contractor has been prevented from earning further head office overheads due to his inability to take up further works because his site resources are tied up by this project because of the delay. That is to day the Contractor has lost the opportunity to earn further head office overheads.
		- This might be challenged by requiring the Contractor to prove that he did have the opportunity to secure further works and he did decline a real possible project.
	- On-cost incurred
		- During the period of prolongation, head office services are continued to be required to support the project, the contribution towards the head office overheads would reasonably be required, without such contribution, the Contractor's business cannot sustain.
		- This might be challenged that the Contractor would still have to keep his head office operating no matter whether the project is prolonged or not, there should not be any loss or increased expense. It may further be challenged by saying that even if there are fewer project, the mark-up percentage would not be increased because of the market competition. 
	- Additional cost incurred
		- During the period of prolongation, additional head office staff and resources are employed to serve the project.
		- This might be challenged by a request to prove that additional head office staff and resources were employed because it would be unlikely to have that need due to prolongation.
	- Not recovered elsewhere
		- Head office overheads are usually priced based on a percentage mark-up on the costs of projects. That percentage mark-up would be estimated based on the ratio of the yearly head office overheads to the yearly costs of projects. Therefore, time is a factor in the calculation. Given a fixed amount of yearly head office overheads, decreased yearly costs of projects would increase the required mark-up percentage, if competitive market conditions can be ignored.
		- The use of formula purports to calculate the under-recovery of the head office overheads due to the prolongation by maintaining the same average level of mark-up percentage over the full period of construction.
		- The formular approach may be challenged as it involves many approximations and averaging not truly reflecting the actual loss and expense. Due to market conditions, the mark-up percentage for a particular project may deviate from those of the past years and may vary from project to project tendered for during the same period.
		- On the other hand, the formula approach is simple and easy to use when a comprehensive or a quick resolution is desired. If the items using the formula approach are broken into smaller parts, the degree of approximations and averaging can be reduced to an acceptable level. 
- Head office overhead percentage
	- Usually the Contractor's past audited accounts for the the past three or five years would be used to analyze the mark-up percentage that the Contractor might have used to price the project or that might need to be applied during the course of the project.
	- Using more than one year's data is to iron out irregular fluctuations from year to year.
	- Only regular running office overheads should be admitted.
	- Occasional fixed expenses or irregular expenses like purchase of office, major equipment, excessive entertainment, etc., should be excluded
	- Instead of calculating an overall mark-up percentage, item by item in the audited accounts can be scrutinized as to their appropriateness and relevance for the long term running of the head office. Exclusion or discounting should be applied as appropriate.
	- Whether an item of expenditure should be classified as HO OH should be reviewed, e.g. in respect of project staff stationing in the office and serving more than one project.
	- Take out OH  and project cost in relation to other non-construction business
	- The audited account of the years when the project are still running may be distorted by the effect of the project, but should still serve as a useful reference. If the purpose is not so much about the increase or decrease in the level of head office resources, but the general level to keep the company going, then this should not be a problem.
- Full Contract Sum or not in formula "Contract Sum x (Period of Prolongation / Contract Period) x Head Office Overheads percentage"
	- A distinction should be made between mark-up and margin. Since the Contract Sum is also inclusive of HO OH, when applying the analyzed mark-up percentage to the Contract Sum, it should be converted to a margin percentage, or alternatively the Contract Sum should first be discounted to take out the head office overheads before applying the mark-up percentage.
	- Furthermore, since the full Contract Sum would usually include unpriced portions like PC / Pro Sums, the Contractor's mark-up for HO OH would only be included in the preliminaries prices and the unit rates for the measured works. When analyzing the mark-up percentage, care should be taken to ensure how PC / Pro Sums are treated in the calculation of the costs of projects. If the denominator includes PC / Pro Sums, it would be reasonable to apply the percentage to the Contract Sum without deducting PC / Pro Sum. 
- Documentary proofs
	- Records of tender invitations that the Contractor had declined during the period of delay; and that such work would have earned similar level of OH recovery
	- Proof supporting that the Contractor was prevented from taking further works, e.g. evidence of management meeting minutes, memos, internal directives and the like for turning down works.
	- Audited accounts
	- Detailed accounting records, only to be viewed at the Contractor's office to preserve business and staff's personal secretes
	- Detailed payroll records of expensive management staff and project staff stationing in the office and serving more than one project to ensure appropriate apportionment of the costs, only to be viewed at the Contractor's office to preserve business secretes
- Adjustments to avoid double recovery of HO OH
	- Mark-up and margin issue for OH %
	- HO OH recovered through net variation addition. For the overall period of construction, there could be other variations which would contribute to HO OH. Since the formula is used with the view of keeping the Contractor's monthly average HO OH over the full period at the "expected" same level, then since the Contractor is given the opportunity to earn HO OH during the same full period, additional HO OH recovered through VO should be subtracted.
	- It may be argued that only the variations causing the delay and prolongation in question should be taken into consideration ignoring all others
	- If by agreement the contract preliminaries prices are used to calculate the additional site overheads due to prolongation, the additional HO OH recovered through the preliminaries prices used in the calculation should be subtracted.

#Defect 
## Question

Question No. 2 – Defects Rectification

Notes to Candidates: Please state the Standard Form of Contract upon which your answer is based.

You are the Consultant QS of a residential development project including a club house. The building works carried out by Perfect Builder Limited have been certified completed six months ago. The Contract consists of a standard defects rectification clause with a defects liability period of 12 months after completion. The fitting out works for the club house is now under construction by Good Fit Company.

After a heavy rainstorm last week, water leakage was found at the joints of the skylight topping the clubhouse. The skylight was part of the building works of Perfect Builder Limited.

After an initial study on the extent of the defects, the Architect instructed Perfect Builder Limited to rectify the defects. At the same time, Good Fit Company was notified and he agreed to allow access for Perfect Builder Limited. However, since the defects rectification work lies on the critical path of the programme of the fitting out works, it is anticipated that EOT and L&E will be incurred by Good Fit Company.

After an ad-hoc meeting among the Architect, Perfect Builder Limited and Good Fit Company, the Architect called and asked for your opinions regarding the following issues:

(a) For rectification of other defects during the defects liability period, the Architect and the Employer are not satisfied with the generally slow progress of Perfect Builder Limited, the Employer is eager to know what his rights and obligations are under the Contract.  

(b) Perfect Builder Limited responded negatively at the ad-hoc meeting and argued that all the inspection and waterproof test had been carried out before the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate, hence, he should not be responsible for the damage caused by heavy rainstorm which occurred after certified completion.  

(c) The carrying out of the defects rectification work lies on the critical path of the programme of the fitting out works, hence, Good Fit Company will likely be entitled to extension of time and loss and expense compensation. What would be the position and considerations of the Employer who intends to recover the loss and expense from Perfect Building Limited?

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- C shall be responsible for rectifying defects within a reasonable time after Architect's instruction (cl.17.3(2), (3))
	- Therefore, the Architect should issue a schedule of defects and instruct C to rectify.
	- If C fails to comply within the reasonable time, Employer can engage others (cl.4.3(3), (4)). C shall permit others so appointed to carry out the rectification work without hindrance.
	- It is both the liability and right of C to rectify defects himself, E cannot ignore C and simply employer others for rectification work without following the due procedures.
	- Alternatively, Architect may instruct C not to rectify some or all of the defects and make a reasonable reduction to the Contract Sum (cl.17.3(5))
- B
	- Defects in the Works caused by either materials, goods or workmanship which are not in accordance with the Contract are breaches of contract by Contractor. This is different from damage caused by natural causes after SC.
	- A leakage through joints would very likely be due to the joints not having been properly according to the Contract. If this is the case, then this will be defect exposed by the rainstorm, not a damage caused by the rainstorm.
	- Skylight by its nature and intended purpose should be watertight. The Contract should be checked to see whether there is any specific specification clause or warranty clauses in this respect.
	- A completion cert is a proof that Architect is satisfied that the Works have been substantially completed, but the certificate does not prove the Works are free from minor defects or latent defects not discovered before issuing the certificate.
	- Passing of inspection and testing of the Works does not relieve the Contractor from liability for defects, especially latent defects, found during the DLP
	- No Architect's certificates, except the Final Certificate, shall constitute an evidence that any materials, goods, workmanship or work to which the certificate relates are in accordance with contract requirement (cl.32.12).
	- Furthermore, in both cases, Final Cert and Defects Rectification Cert exclude latent defects not discoverable by the time of their issue. 
	- Joint investigation among parties should be carried out immediately to identify and establish the cause and liability for the defects
	- The Contract should also be checked to see whether the skylight was carried out by s specialist subcon who may have submitted a form of warranty to Employer to warranty the due performance. While C's liability remain, it provides the Employer with another means to directly approach the specialist subcon based on the terms of warranty for redress
	- C may rely on cl.17.6 for Specified Peril after SC. Specified Peril definition. And may argue that this should override whatever materials and workmanship clauses. To counter-argue, one has to justify that the case is a defect exposed by rainstorm, not a damage caused by rainstorm.
- C
	- Defective work means a Contractor's failure to comply with the express or implied terms of the Contract, hence it is a breach of contract by the Contractor.
		- Contractor's rectification of defects following contract requirements would not prejudice Employer's other rights and remedies under the common law regarding breach of contract.
		- SFBC cl.32.9(1) affords a relief to the Contractor for defects which could reasonably have been but have not been discovered upon the issue of the Defects Rectification Certificate. On the other hand, cl.17.7 & 32.9(2) expressly preserves the Employer's common law right notwithstanding the issue of Defects Rectification Certificate.
		- Apart from rectification of the defects, Contractor shall be liable for loss or damage which arises naturally from a breach of contract and reasonably in contemplation of both parties at the time of contracting
	- Whether the Employer is entitled to recover the full amount of loss and expense will depend on:
		- Whether C should reasonably have known about the subsequent contract, aware of the possible consequential damage and liabilities incurred by Employer to subsequent contract
		- Whether Employer has acted reasonably to mitigate the loss
	- Apart from the entitlement, whether the Employer will actually be able to recover the entitled amount subsequent contractor would be another matter since C would most likely expect to rectify the defects only without additional liability.
	- Recommendation
		- A warning of possible liability may push the Contractor to rectify faster
		- If the loss and expense are likely to be huge, it would be advisable to notify C and invite him to suggest any possible mitigation measures. On the other hand, a warning of very huge loss and expense liability may cause a rebound from C with refusal to cooperate.
		- While CAR and TPI would not cover defects in the Works, it would cover loss or damage caused by the defects to other parts of the Works or third party property. Although it is in the DLP, it would still be worthwhile to submit an insurance claim. Compensation may also be sought from the insurances taken out by Employer after SC.

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 3 – Contractor’s Proposed Changes to the Works

You are the Consultant Project Quantity Surveyor of a residential development project. In the last project progress meeting, the Contractor proposed to change the specified tiling adhesive system to another system with a view to save cost.

The Project Manager is seeking your contractual advice on the matter. You are required to draft a letter to the Project Manager:

(a) explaining whether the Contractor’s proposed change is a variation under the Contract;  

(b) highlighting the considerations (any kind) to which the Employer should pay attention when deciding whether to accept the proposed changes or not; and 

(c) recommending how to accept the change.

## Assessor Notes

- Variation or not
	- By cl.1, Variation refers to a change instructed by Architect to the design, quality or quantity of the Works or the imposition of an obligation or restriction instructed by Architect regarding access, working space, working time or working sequence. A Variation must have an Architect's instruction.
	- Cl.8.1(3) states that if any of the specified materials or goods are not procurable, then Contractor shall submit alternatives for approval which may lead to no adjustment to the Contract Sum if the proposed alternative is of similar type and standard and of comparable quality and price to those specified, or lead to an Architect instruction for a Variation to adjust. This clause applies to materials or goods becoming not procurable, but does not cover other cases, though the principle may be adopted for other cases, but the application and implication must be clearly stated. The clause does not state whether the Variation price adjustment should be based on the full or shared part of the cost reduced. Some negotiation would be required for Variation instruction to be issued.
	- It may be difficult to distinguish whether AI or written note to approve Contractor's proposal intends to be variation instruction. To avoid ambiguity, the Contract Bills or Specification would usually contain a clause stating that the approval of the Contractor's proposal does not constitute variation.
- Approval considerations
	- Impact on the programme
	- Quality concerns
	- Sharing of the cost saving
	- Technical and financial implications on affected elements not being a subject of the Contractor's proposal change but possibly affect by it
	- Design responsibility of the construction elements involved in the Contractor's proposed change
	- Professional indemnity
	- Cost-effectiveness on a whole-life basis
	- Other considerations such as environmental and aesthetical impacts
	- Undertakings and warranties
- Accepting the change
	- If, normally, by some clauses in the Contract Bills or Specification, the approval of a Contractor's proposal will not constitute a variation, the Contractor would assume that the Contract Sum will not be reduced because the alternative proposal is cheaper.
	- Without or without those clauses, a simple approval of the Contractor's proposal change would not constitute a variation if no documented by means of AI.
	- The Architect knowing that there would be substantial cost saving the Contractor should not simply approve the Contractor's approval but should not simply approve the Contractor's approval but should treat the change as a variation to be authorized by AI.
	- There should be some negotiation as to how the cost saving should be enjoyed or shared, and some understanding as to the time and other effects taking into account the consideration above before issuing the AI. 
	- AI does not need counter-signature by Contractor. To document that the content is based on mutual agreement, a separate note documenting the mutual agreement should be signed by Contractor and Employer / Architect on the Employer's behalf.
	- SFBC cl.13.4(6) substantial change

## Question

Question No. 4 – Formwork System

Your boss of a local developer heard that it is currently very difficult to employ sufficient carpenters for erection of formwork due to aging of carpenters in the local market. He is thinking if it is more suitable to use aluminium formwork for the construction of the reinforced concrete works of a proposed residential development.

- Project Details
	CFA : 12,000m2
	
	Site Area : 1,000m2
	
	The Works :
		![image.png|300](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805131026.png)

The structure is generally of reinforced concrete with transfer plate, load bearing walls, column and beam framing with suspended slabs.

The external walls are mainly precast reinforced concrete facades and in-situ reinforced concrete walls.

The internal partitions are mainly in-situ reinforced concrete walls and block walls.

You are working as a Contract Manager for this local developer. You are requested by your boss to advise on the suitability of using aluminium formwork in lieu of traditional timber formwork for constructing the reinforced concrete works for the areas not using precast reinforced concrete facades of this proposed residential development.

Please draft a memo to your boss to advise on the suitability, for general cases, of using aluminium formwork in terms of:

(a) time;  
(b) cost; and  
(c) restrictions and other merits; and

give recommendations with reference to the specific project details of this proposed residential development.

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Time
	- Long lead time is required for manufacturing aluminium formwork in factory
	- Floor layout and structural design must be finalized in advance for preparation of aluminium formwork design
	- Openings for building services works must also be coordinated well in advance before the manufacture of aluminium formwork
	- Time required for going through the "learning curve" for using aluminium formwork for the first few floors may be longer when compared with using traditional timber formwork
	- On-site installation of aluminium formwork is quicker because of lighter weight if not much in-situ adaptation is required
	- During rainy days, carpenters would stop the use of woodworking saw machine so as to prevent electric shock. Unlike the erection of traditional timber formwork, the erection of aluminium formwork does not involve the use of woodworking saw machine. Metal formwork erectors can still work in light rain. The possibility of keeping the scheduled days of concreting cycle is higher.
- Cost
	- Aluminium formwork materials newly manufactured and delivered to site cost much more than traditional timber formwork
	- On the other hand, aluminium formwork used on other sites before and easily adapted for a new project due to similarity will cost much less
	- Normal daily wages of metal formwork erectors are much lower than those of carpenter
	- Timber formwork uses skillful carpenters which are highly insufficient in the construction market. Aluminium formwork requires less skill on site and uses metal formwork erectors who are easier to employ without jacking up the wages for a particular project. It can help secure the stability of the cost of the formwork.
	- Whether it is cheaper per unit area of formwork to use aluminium formwork is very much dependent on the extent of repetitive use of aluminium formwork with the least amount of in-situ adaptation, cutting and waste. Logically, non-typical floors would not be suitable for using aluminium formwork.
	- The cost benefits of saving in the overall construction time would be a major factor for consideration 
- Restrictions and other merits
	- Once aluminium formwork has been manufactured, changes in layout or design may involve extensive abortive work, which may in turn cause extensive time and cost implications.
	- Some contractors may not be familiar with the design and erection of aluminium formwork, the requirement for using aluminium formwork may discourage their submission of tenders
	- Few trade sub-contractors are experienced in aluminium formwork than in timber formwork
	- As building services works are required to be coordinated before the manufacture of aluminium formwork, this would probably encourage the Employer and design team to freeze the design and coordinate the structural works and building services works much in advance when compared with using traditional timber formwork. 
	- Theoretically, aluminium formwork can enhance better quality of concrete surfaces after removal of the formwork. The extent of making good work at step joints and concrete surfaces should be smaller when compared with using traditional timber formwork.
	- It is a kind of green construction. It can be a merit to reduce construction waste of unused timber formwork. Aluminium formwork can be reused on other sites or resold for recycled use.
- Recommendations
	- Because of the need to give time for the design and manufacture of aluminium formwork, if the piling and foundations are under a previous piling contract, it is unlikely that there would be enough time for the basement to use aluminium formwork.
	- Because aluminium formwork needs higher degree of standardization and repetition to be cost and time effective, it is not suitable to use aluminium formwork for basement, podium, refuge floor, duplex floors, and generator room.
	- Subject to other considerations, in view of the cost effectiveness and the programming certainty of aluminium formwork on the typical floors, those 38-sotrey typical floors should be suitable, provided it is unlikely to change the floor design in response to market conditions. The floor layout and design should be finalized well in advance so as to avoid abortive work. The likelihood of change in response to market conditions should also be low, otherwise, the time and cost would become much higher than those when using timber formwork.

## Assessor Notes

- Footprint area: same
- CFA: 10800 -> 11880 m2
- Advance works: same
- Foundation
	- Building is taller than before. The CFA above ground is increased. Total loading is increased. The omission of basement may reduce the loading, or conversely may not be able to take advantage of bouyancy effect of the basement to relieve loading. 
	- As Structural Engineering has confirmed that there would be no significant effect to the foundation design, the cost of foundation can be kept as same, but that confirmation must be clearly recorded in the revised estimate
- Basement and ELS
	- The original cost should be broken down into sub-elements in reasonable cost proportions.
		- Excavation and disposal - volume of excavation x $/m3
		- ELS - volume of excavation x $/m3, or perimeter x depth below ground x $/m2
		- Basement bottom - footprint area x $/m2
		- Basement sides - perimeter x height x $/m2
		- Basement suspended floor - suspended area x $/m2 (may be treated as part of structural frame)
	- With the reduction of the basement construction, allowances should be made for the normal substructure elements like footings, structural walls, columns, ground beams and ground slabs, including related excavation and disposal, areas outside the basement. The allowances may be made by means of unit cost per footprint of the building using a rate somewhere between the structural frame element $/CFA and the basement unit cost per footprint (excluding walls and suspended floors), or by approximate quantities.
- Structural frame
	- Increase in CFA
	- Only limited number of columns are allowed at the Hall relocated from the top floor to G/F. That means some kind of transfer structures will be required at the slab over the Hall to transfer the loading of the upper floors upon the 1/F structural frame down to the limited number of structural columns at the Hall on G/F.  Allowance over the normal structural frame should be made based on the estimated extra $/area of the 1/F which should be a multiple of the normal structural frame $/CFA due to different thickness.
	- Bonus if detailed calculation of transfer structures
- Facade
	- The original cost should be broken down into facade are (perimeter x building height) x  $/m2 by working out the facade area first. The unit cost per facade area can then be applied to the new design.
	- Bonus if calculate the facade to floor area ratio.
	- State assumption that the ratio of glazing to solid wall is similar
- Architectural and Building Works
	- The original elemental unit cost can be used for the new design. CFA is the same
	- Allowance for pool and pool deck finishing, pool fittings, additional changing room, toilet, plant room in additional CFA
	- Bonus if consider increase in water tank size
- Building Services
	- Reasonable assumption to allow for extra costs of plumbing and above-ground drainage, pumps, etc. Due to the addition of the pool and wet areas associated changing rooms, toilets and plant rooms
	- Cost of filtration plant system $1.5-2M
	- Bonus for asking Architect that the pool is a heated pool or a cold water-only pool
- External works and drainage
	- Increase due to increased discharge capacity of the drainage system to cater for the additional pool, and possibly increased size of incoming water mains
	- The drainage system previously accommodated in the basement and possibly allowed for under the building services element will need to be moved to here with additions for additional trenches and manholes
- Preliminaries and contingencies
	- Correspondingly adjusted
- Cost summary with explanatory notes
	- Overall cost and cost per m2.
	- List of assumptions and exclusions
	- Cost reconciliation summary with reasons provided separately or as part of cost summary

## Assessor Notes

- Alternative hoarding proposal
	- Although it is often specified in the tender doc that tenderer's proposal site layout plan will be for reference only and shall not override the tender doc, and it if often that the LOA will declare that the proposed site layout plant will not form part of the Contract. Significant deviation of the proposed site layout plan from tender doc requirements should be addressed, and clarification of the cost and time effects of the removal of the deviation should be made with the tenderer to avoid argument.
	- B has inserted a saving in tender sum build-up, which amounted to a qualification of tender.
	- Clarification should be obtained from B as to:
		- (1) Who would take up the design and statutory submission responsibilities in case its proposal is accepted by Employer? Whether the full cost and time effects of its proposal on the Works including consequential changes to the Works due to its proposal have been considered in the tender sum? 
			- Bonus for associated cost including professional fees for preparation of necessary submissions, additional temporary works such as diversion of utilities, tree protection or transplanting, site security, cleaning, etc.
		- (2) What would be the time and cost implications if its proposal is rejected by Government authorities? Would the Employer only be liable for $200,000 being the saving previously offered?
	- If it is considered that B's proposal has no merit or very little chance of success, then probably only (2) would be necessary.
	- If it is considered that the qualification should not be considered whatsoever irrespective of any potential merit, B should be told that its proposal has amounted to a qualification and the qualification should be withdrawn without adjustment to the tender sum or completion time. 
	- If B's proposal is considered to have merit and has good chance of success, and if this is not considered to be a qualification which has to be rejected whatsoever, then it may be worthwhile to ask other tenders for the cost and time implications. However, the design and statutory submission responsibilities should be clearly stated because this will not be a tenderer's proposal from the other tenderers' perspective. The answers can be treated as a post contract variation without now changing the tender sum.
	- Bonus to mention fairness
		- Tenderer's technical submission are to demonstrate their technical capability and competence to complete the works. In fair tendering, it is not appropriate to request the other tenderers to adopt other's technical proposal and revise tender sum. This should be the case especially if the technical proposal involves special intellectual thoughts. However, since B has qualified his tender, unless his qualification is withdrawn, accepting his qualified tender without giving a chance to other tenderers to quote would also be unfair.
- Proposed specialist not on list
	- It should first be checked whether
		- The tender doc have stated that the recommended list is a restrictive list meaning that the tenderer would not be allowed to proposed others not on the list
		- A deviation would amount to a disqualification of the tender
	- If the deviation would amount to a disqualification of the tender, then the tender cannot be considered further 
	- If the tender will not be disqualified right away, but the list is restrictive, the tenderer should be asked to adjust and choose from the list at no change to the rest of the tender.
	- If the Employer wishes to relax in respect of the restrictive list or disqualification, other tenderers should be given a chance to propose others not on the list
	- If the list is not restrictive, then it is up to the consultants and the Employer to consider whether the proposed sub-contractor is acceptable or not, and there is no need to give other tenderers another chance
		- It would not be good to disapprove the proposed sub-contractor in the post contract stage because the tenderer's prices and quality of the curtain wall will very much depend on the sub-contractor chosen, so the acceptability should be considered now.
		- Prior to any assessment of proposed sub-contractor, H should be requested to give reasons for not using the recommended sub-contractors given in the tender documents. The reasons may include:
			- High pricing by the recommended sub-contractors
			- No quotation was received from the recommended sub-contractors
			- Poor relations with the recommended sub-contractors in past projects
			- Heavy workload of the recommended sub-contractors
			- Better price, quality and past long term relationship with the proposed sub-contractor
		- H should also be requested to submit sub-contractor's background, project team, past project experience, recognized trade license and other relevant qualifications for review by the consultants and the Employer. In case the curtain wall is considered to be very important, H's proposed sub-contractor could be asked to demonstrate his understanding of the design requirements and any other key issues relevant to the project.
		- If there is sufficient evident that H's proposed sub-contractor is not capable of carrying out the specialist work, H should be requested to choose a sub-contractor from the recommended list and stand by his tender sum, or face disqualification of his tender.
- Rate-only Schedule for abortive work
	- Rate-only schedule is a good tool for cost control. It will enhance the efficiency in valuation of abortive work and settlement of final account. However, how extensive the schedule should be would depend on the likelihood of the abortive work occurring. 
	- In many projects, abortive work is unavoidable. The abortive work caused by the Contractor, usually due to poor materials and workmanship, will have to be borne by Contractor. The abortive work to be borne by Employer is usually caused by late change of design.
	- It would take additional time for the preparation of the schedule, subsequent analysis and clarification with the tenderers. If the rates quoted are too high, time would be needed to conduct negotiation. If the tenderers stand firm, the Employer may have to accept because of the limited time to award the contract. However, if the abortive work is valued as and when it arises, there would be ample time to check and agree the prices.
	- For organisations which do not adopt the practice of tender negotiation, the freedom will be limited, because the pricing of the schedule may be regarded as providing a room to make good the tender sums already submitted.
	- Whether the schedule should be prepared should take the above into consideration.
	- If decided to be issued, instead of a schedule of items initiated by G, such schedule should be prepared by QS in conjunction with other consultants.
		- Where practicable, typical details and specification relevant to the common items in connection with abortive work should be given
		- Measurement method and preambles notes should be given'
		- The item descriptions should specify the range of quantities within which the rates are still applicable to cater to the possibility that the quantities can vary significantly
		- Issue the same schedule to all lowest three as PTQ would enable a comparative check on the reasonableness of the prices, and see whether the order of the tenders would be changed
		- Provide provisional quantities in the schedule will have the merit of giving an indication of the probable extent of the work for better pricing. However, as the exact extent of abortive work is not known at this stage, if the pro qty is found to be seriously out of order, the Contractor may still argue that the variance in the actual extent should warrant a re-rating. It may therefore be simpler just to ask for rates without qty, while approximate qty are only used for internal pricing comparison.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Defects Rectification

You are the quantity surveyor of the Consulting QS Firm engaged by the Employer to prepare the tender documents for the construction of a new theatre building. It is confirmed with the Employer and the Architect that there will be a Lift Nominated Sub-Contract (Lift NSC) to the Main Contract (MC). The defects rectification clauses in the MC are without amendment and the defects liability period (DLP) is 12 months.

Before the tender documents are officially issued, the Employer’s Project Manager (PM) raised his concern to you about the duration of the defects liability period which in his opinion 12-months DLP would be too short. He has come up with the following two alternatives and would like to seek for your advice.

- Alternative A
	With regard to the several serious lift accidents that have happened in Hong Kong in the recent years, the DLP for the Lift NSC should be 36 months, while the DLP for the MC will remain as 12 months.
	
	The PM queried if this would be contractually feasible?

- Alternative B
	In order to provide further and better quality assurance to the Employer, the DLP of the MC including that of Lift NSC shall be 36 months in lieu of 12 months.
	
	The PM would like to know what the contractual and financial implications would be for such a change in the duration of the DLP?

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Lift NSC 36m, MC 12m
	- A sub-contract is formed between MC and NSC and there is no privity of contract between E and NSC.
		- Governed by the chain of responsibility formed among E, MC and NSC, E could enforce his rights to have the defects of NSC rectified against MC instead of directly against NSC. Likewise, MC is duty bound to respond to E's request for rectification of defects including those of NSC. E may have another means to directly approach NSC if a Form of Warranty is given by NSC to E.
		- To maintain the chain of responsibility between MC and NSC, the DLP of NSC should be the same as consistent with that of MC.
	- To entertain the request but maintain the consistency, DLP of MC may be re-defined as 36 months for NSC and 12 months for the rest of MC, permitting release of the last retention in two parts which may be apportioned according to values of works.
		- If surety bond required to be provided by MC is to be released upon the satisfactory expiry of DLP instead of upon substantial completion, it may also be specified that the bonded amount can be partially reduced upon the expiry of the 12 months DLP of the rest of MC. The surety bond required to be provided by NSC under Form of Warranty would still be retained until the satisfactory expiry of the 36 month DLP.
		- Lifts will require periodical maintenance and repair service after the completion of the works, such service is different from rectification of defects, and is usually required under another contract provision. It should be specified that NSC will need to provide that service as well for the extended period of DLP. NSC will factor that in the tender sum, but this is not really an extra because the cost would need to be spent anyway. 
		- It is therefore contractually feasible to entertain the request but the Conditions of MC and NSC would need to be amended to suit, and the tender sum of NSC should be expected to increase.
	- As an alternative to the above, since it is normal to required NSC to provide a Form of Warranty to Employer, MC DLP may still be kept as normal, while extra 24 months DLP of NSC may be stipulated in Form of Warranty. The drawback would be the MC's and NSC's retention would be released upon expiry of the first 12 months. However, since the NSC will have an interest to secure the contract for the long term maintenance and repair service for the lifts, there should be an incentive for NSC to perform. If there is no confidence that NSC will perform, then it should not be invited to tender in the first place.
- Lift NSC & MC 36m
	- Changing DLP of whole MC to 36 months will
		- Affect MC and all NSC, DSC
		- Increase cost of rectification since more defects will appear during extended period
		- Defer the time of release of last retention money and release of bond
		- Lengthen the period of third party insurance and ECI
		- Increase the likelihood of delayed settlement of final accounts pending completion of defects
	- For lifts and MEP works which usually have periodical maintenance and repair service to be paid for, the extra cost of rectification are not really an extra by comparison, but the drawbacks of earlier payment as discussed above should be noted.
	- For other works which do not usually have periodical maintenance and repair service to be paid for, MC and subcon will have to allow for the costs of rectification as an extra over the normal. Products which have short life expectancy may need to be released and would be expected to be replaced within the extended period of DLP though this may not strictly be a defect.
	- The deferred release of retention money will cause extra financing charges on retention money for extended period
	- The deferred release of the surety bond will cause extra premiums for the extended period. However, non-release of the surety bond would lock up MC and subcon's credit facilities and this would affect their financial and tendering capabilities. They may be deterred from tendering.
	- Product warranty periods often run after installation or substantial completion. The lengthening of DLP would make DLP overlap the warranty periods more. 
	- Specialized products may have shorter standard warranty period
	- Extended DLP also extends provision of consultancy services by consultants, additional consultant fees will be required.
	- Extended DLP may give Contractor an impression of no urgency in rectifying defects.
	- Therefore, not recommended.

## Question

Question No. 4 – Contract Execution and Assignment

A consulting quantity surveyor prepared a draft set of Main Contract documents and the associated nominated sub-contract (NSC) documents for the Employer’s comment.

The Employer’s Project Manager (PM) noted that he is required to sign on the attestation page of the Main Contract but not on that of the NSC. He wonders if this is a deliberate arrangement and asked for the rationale behind this. He also doubts how the Employer’s interest could be safeguarded if the Employer is not a party to the Nominated Sub-Contract.

The PM is also concerned that there are a couple of NSC packages that have to be awarded prior to the award of the Main Contract. He asked for advice on how to ensure the contractual proprieties are observed in awarding the sub-contracts in the absence of the Main Contractor.

He asked if it is feasible for him to sign the sub-contract with the NSC followed by assigning the sub-contract to the Main Contractor upon the award of the Main Contract.

You, being the consulting quantity surveyor, is required to give your advice by way of a letter to the PM.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Signing
	- Despite the fact that NSC is nominated by E, NSC is employed by MC. Sub-Contract is to be signed between and by the two contract parties only, being MC and NSC. There is no direct contractual link (privity of contract) between E and NSC. E is not a party to Sub-Contract. Therefore, E is not required to sign on the attestation page of NSC. If he likes, he can sign as a witness but this does not add anything to his rights.
- Safeguarding
	- In the absence of a privity of contract between E and NSC, E would not be able to sue NSC for any action or inaction in connection with the Sub-Contract Works. However, NSC works are deemed to be part of MC works. MC works are governed by Main Contract between E and MC. MC is accountable to E for the performance of NSC in carrying out NSC works. Therefore, E is protected. The forgoing principle has been handled by most standard forms. In the day to day running of project, NSC will often have direct dialogues with consultants and PM while observing the formal channel of communication.
	- Some exception to this chain of responsibility would be MC will not be responsible for NSC's design responsibility and MC will not be responsible to find a replacement NSC in case the original NSC is determined. To cover the gap, NSC are often required to provide E with a Form of Warranty guaranteeing the due performance of NSC including design, selection of materials, and on time completion, etc. And a requirement to provide a surety bond to E.
- Assignment after signing first
	- Rationale
		- Signing the Sub-Contract with NSC first would ensure a binding contract between E and NSC. Both E and NSC will have greater assurance of the sustainability of the Sub-Contract. NSC can start ordering long lead item especially MEP equipment. It is a direct contract for the time being.
		- Subsequently transferring to MC will be able to relieve E from the bounds of the Sub-Contract.
	- Approach
		- Assignment may not be the appropriate approach in the circumstances because assignment of the obligations under a contract is much more difficult than assignment of the rights under the contract. A simple assignment by E to MC with the knowledge of NSC will be able to transfer only rights but not obligations. Without a complete assignment of both rights and obligations with the consent of all three parties involved, some privity of contract still exists between E and NSC, and the Employer's obligations cannot be released.
		- When all three parties' consents are required in any case. A novation agreement is a tri-partite agreement of the three involved parties, through which E drops out from NSC and is substituted by MC. All rights and obligations of E are novated to MC, and MC replace E as the party of Sub-Contract.
		- To address the possibility of objection by MC of nomination of a particular sub-con, and as a more flexible alternative, it is also common for E to issue a Letter of Intent only to NSC stipulating that there is an intention to E to nominate NSC subject to the acceptance by MC and there is no mutual liability if the nomination is not accepted by MC.
			- A drawback if that E is not bound to nominate and NSC is not bound to stay with his tender. Without any assurance, NSC would not start work before acceptance by MC.
			- LOI may go further to stipulate that there is a temporarily binding contract apart from an intention to nominate whereby:
				- NSC shall proceed with Sub-Contract Works in the interim and will get paid by Employer, so as to get the work started
				- If MC accepts NSC, it will be deemed that MC had issued the LOI to NSC in place of E from the beginning, so as to relieve the Employer
				- In case of valid objection by MC, the obligation to nominate will cease, and NSC shall have no claim except for the payment of work done, so as to provide freedom for the Employer to switch

## Question

Question No. 1 – Management Contracting and Partnering

You are the Consulting QS of a very complex building development project which involves multi-disciplinary aspects. The design is not fully developed at the moment and will potentially present major technical risks. As such, the Employer adopted Management Contracting and engaged a Management Contractor for the project. While the project team is about to embark on the drafting of the Works Contract, the Project Manager left the team due to illness. The succeeding Project Manager is puzzled by the procurement arrangement and asked for your advice.

On a separate note, the succeeding Project Manager has joined a number of partnering workshops in his previous projects. He thinks that the workshops were useful but incomplete for enhancing partnering spirit. He would like to have your advice for getting the works contracts more partnering friendly.

Please write a letter to the succeeding Project Manager: -

(i) Briefly explaining the essence of the Management Contracting and outlining the organization structure of Management Contracting; and  

(ii) Suggesting FIVE aspects in which consideration shall be given in drafting the Works Contracts so as to make the Works Contracts more partnering-friendly.

	- The Management Contractor joins the consultant team at the design stage. He tenders a fee to provide services in the pre-construction and construction stages of the project. While he does not carry out the actual construction works, he entered into sub-contracts with Works Contractors who will carry out separate packages of the works. His task is to co-ordinate and supervise the work of various Works Contractors engaged in constructing the works.
	- It provides ways to tap the expertise of the Management Contractor throughout the course of the project including the pre-construction stage. The professional advice on planning, programme and buildability from the contractor's perspective will enrich the ability of the project team to cope with the technical challenges and difficulties which may arise.
	- In a classical management contract, the Management Contractor is not required to take responsibility for the performance of Works Contractors except to the extent that he can offset the responsibility against the Works Contractors. In line with all the other consultants, he is responsible only for the consequences of his own negligence or incompetence. Such an arrangement is intended to preserve the Management Contractor's alliance of aims with the Employer. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710131949.png]]
- Making the Works Contracts more partnering friendly
	- Attitude and mindset
		- It may be specified to have a partnering workshop at the beginning of the Works Contract for all key project team members to get to know each other, align their objectives, and understand the need to adopt a partnering mindset.
		- All people must work with mutual trust and respect in a collaborative manner for the best value of the project as a whole. They should move away from adversarial attitude.
		- Partnering workshops should also be conducted during the course of the Works Contract to review achievement and re-align with each other.
		- Commitment at all levels with strong support by the top level is very important
	- Objectives
		- It may be specified to have a partnering charter or agreement drafted and agreed by all parties involved to document the common objectives and an agreement to collaborate to achieve those common objectives
		- Partnering is about serving the interests of both contract parties or all parties involved in the Works Contract. The tender documents can only specify the objectives of the Employer and the Management Contractor. Chances should be given to the Works Contractor to express his objectives so that all parties can collaborate to achieve his objectives also. The consultant teams may also wish their objectives to be achieved.
		- The partnering charter may be drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop.
		- The objectives may be about the final product, such as good quality, on time, within respective budgets, minimum resources, no fatal accidents, few public complaints, better than expected, added value.
		- The objectives may also be about the process, such as planning ahead, identifying problems in advance, exchanging knowledge, warning proactively, adopting best practice, adopting proven practice, reducing wastes, simplifying tasks, cutting red-tape, improving buildability, finding better alternatives, resolving quickly, rectifying immediately, etc.
		- The objectives may also be about the attitude, such as co-operative, honest, frank, trusting, trustworthy, teamwork, empathic, sharing, no blame, no cheating, fair, wins for all, etc.
		- The partnering charter may have quantifiable key performance indicators.
	- Action plan
		- It may be specified to have an action plan drawn up to document the issues, concerns and risks identified in advance, and the parties and time to resolve them, in order to achieve the partnering objectives.
		- The action plan is usually drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop, and monitored and updated regularly
		- The action plan may be integrated with risk and safety management action plans
	- Monitoring
		- It may be specified to have a champion team comprising high level representatives of the Employer, Management Contractor, Works Contractor and Consultants to meet regularly to monitor the progress of the actin plan, rate mutual performance, resolve issues delayed by the lower level of staff, etc.
		- Contractual procedures may be specified to deal with problems through an "early warning" system with notices, meetings, time limits on a "without prejudice" basis. However, better results would be achieved if these are not put forward unilaterally as contractual procedures but are established and agreed by all parties through early joint discussions,
	- Resolution
		- It may be specified to have an issue resolution mechanism or matrix to identify who should be involved in resolving which kinds of problems, the time durations to resolve or, in case of failure to resolve, submit to higher authority for resolution to avoid delay in problem solving.
		- The involvement of an independent third party adviser to facilitate dispute avoidance and resolution throughout the partnering process would also be an advantage particularly in case of contractual deadlock.
	- Risk allocation
		- It is important to allocate risks to the party best placed to control and bear the risks and to ensure provisions relating to payment terms, grounds for EOT and loss and expenses are in line with the principle of fair risks allocation.
		- While the contract terms must be observed when implementing partnering, putting harsh terms and burden all on the Works Contractor is not serving the interest of the Works Contractor and it would be difficult to expect the Works Contractor to work in a partnering spirit.
		- Arrangement such as cost-plus payment will be most welcome by the Works Contractor but this may affect the Employer's cost control. However, if a partnering spirit is strongly kept with genuine effort to control the costs without extravagancies or reserving buffers for negotiation, the costs spent may as well be the most economical.
	- Incentive
		- It may be specified to have an incentive scheme to award the Works Contractor if he can achieve certain partnering key performance indicators, come below a target cost, finish before a certain date, etc.
		- Some projects also adopt a scheme to award the Consultants as well for their contribution to partnering success.
	- Value engineering
		- It may be specified that the Works Contractor is encouraged to suggest proposals to enhance the value of the project by increasing its functions, benefits and worth, and reducing the resources required.
		- The suggestion can be formulated by a value engineering stud by the Works Contractor himself or jointly with other project team members.
		- Successful achievement of the proposals may lead to incentive awards.
	- De-briefing
		- It may be specified to have a debriefing meeting after the completion of the works to review the failures and successes, and to show appreciation. Partnering is about long term relationship. It would be good that all people involved can learn the lessons, get commendations, and look for future collaboration.

## Question

Question No. 2 – Extension of Time

The Employer has awarded a building contract for the construction of a 40-storey residential building (‘the Contract’) to the Contractor. The Architect instructed the Contractor to commence work on 2 January 2015. The Contract sum is HK$0.45 billion and the time for completion is 30 months.

Work on Site was commenced on 2 January 2015. On 4 February 2015 the Architect instructed the Contractor’s site representative by a letter to defer work on the residential building because of possible design changes that are now under review by the Employer. The Architect had then in a letter dated 16 May 2015 stated there was no intention to alter the design of the residential building and that the remaining work could proceed according to the original contract drawings.

The Contractor has not submitted any notice of delay or claim for additional payment but he re-programmed to ensure the remaining works of the Contract would be completed as soon as practicable. Despite what the Contractor has done, the Architect considered that the Contractor had failed to carry out the works of the Contract with due expedition. The Architect told the Contractor that he had advised the Employer to deduct liquidated and ascertained damages from the coming Interim Payment Certificate No. 9.

The Contractor disputed the Architect’s opinion and lodged a complaint to the Employer among other things that no extension of time or additional payment for the suspension has been assessed so far.

The Employer asked you, as the Consulting Quantity Surveyor, to advise him on his contractual position. Please draft a letter in response to the Employer’s request and explaining the relevant considerations in these circumstances.

(i) Whether the Architect’s letters dated 4 February and 16 May 2015 have served as Architect’s Instructions?  

(ii) What are the consequences if the Contractor fails to give the requisite notices for delay and monetary claim arising from the postponement of the works?  

(iii) What are the considerations and implications for taking the Architect’s advice to deduct liquidated and ascertained damages from the certified amount in the coming Interim Payment Certificate No. 9?

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Form of instructions
	- There is no prescribed form under the Contract Conditions for AI. As long as the instructions are issued by Architect in writing to the Contractor, they are valid. The two letters served the purpose.
- Contractor's notices
	- Delay occasioned by an AI postponing or suspending part of works is a ground for EOT under clause 25.1(3)(j) and a ground for recovering L&E under clause 27.1(2)(e)(iii)
	- Contractor is required to give notices of delay in accordance with cl.25.1&25.2. Cl.25.3(4) provides that if the Contractor fails to submit the notices within the time frame prescribed under clause 25.1 or 25.2 but a first notice is nevertheless submitted, the Architect shall give an EOT to the Contractor to the extent that he is able to on the information available. 
	- The Contractor is also required to give notices of claim in accordance with clause 28.1 and submit particulars of the claim in accordance with clause 28.2. Clause 28.3 provides that it is a condition precedent to the Contractor's entitlement to additional payment that the Contractor shall comply with the provisions of cl.28.1&28.2.
	- Apparently, the Contractor has lost his entitlement because of his failure to submit due notices and claims within the prescribed times. However, when a delay is not due to neutral events but due to the acts of omissions of the Employer, it is a common law principle that EOT should not be granted as a remedy of the Employer's fault even though no notice or claims has been submitted by the Contractor in accordance with Contract. The Employer cannot benefit from his own fault by imposing damages for delay caused by himself. The Architect shall still grant EOT. 
	- For L&E, the onus of proof in on the Contractor, and the Contractor may be defeated by following the strict contractual terms, but a more equitable treatment may be more appropriate as the delay was actually caused by the Employer.
- Deduction of LAD and consequence of wrong deduction
	- The date for completion is not due yet.
	- The Employer shall have no right to deduct LAD before date for completion. The Contractor is committed to deliver the Works to the Employer by the Date or Extended Date for Completion. The liability for LAD for delay will only arise when the date for completion is passed while the works remain incomplete. Besides, the Architect's certificate of non-completion in accordance with cl.24.1, which is a pre-condition to the Employer's recovery of LAD from Contractor has not been issued. It is also a requirement that EOT should have been duly considered before issuing the certificate of non-completion. 
	- The Employer shall have no right to deduct LAD from the payment for IP No.9. If the Employer does so, it would amount to a default in payment which would entitle the Contractor to invoking the determination cl.36.1 or to requesting for interests on payment withheld.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Instruction Clarifying Discrepancies

You are the Consulting Quantity Surveyor for a new build project of a 40 levels residential cum commercial block development. Level 1 to level 3 are for commercial use whereas level 4 and above are residential units. The Main Contract for the superstructure including building services installations is awarded to Best Build Construction Ltd (Best Build).

In the early stage of the project, Best Build found that there was discrepancy between the contract drawings and the bills of quantities on the capacity of the water pumps for the Fire Hydrant System. Best Build issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 24 February 2015 to the Architect and copied the same to the Consulting Building Services Engineer enquiring whether they should place order on the water pumps based on the capacities as shown on the contract drawings or based on the item description stated in the bills of quantities. Best Build stated in the RFI that they expected the Architect to respond the RFI within 14 days by 9 March 2015.

In late February 2015, the Employer agreed with a buyer that Level 3 to 4 would be used for residential care homes for the elderly (an elderly center). The Architect checked and confirmed that obtaining the license for the operation of the elderly center will not contravene the lease conditions and the Deed of Mutual Covenant. The Consulting Structural Engineer also confirmed that the floor to ceiling height could accommodate the above provisions and there would be no structural impact on the current design scheme including the foundation. However, the Consulting Building Services Engineer advised that some building services systems would have to be revised and one of the significant changes would be the additional provision of the sprinkler system to the proposed elderly center.

Two weeks before the scheduled concreting works for the fire services water pump room at Level 1, the Architect issued an instruction:

(a) to confirm the capacity of the water pumps shown on contract drawings for Fire Hydrant System instead of that shown in the bills of quantities; and (b) to add the sprinkler system and associated pipework for the elderly center.

Three days later, the project team receives a letter from the Contractor

- Letter to the Architect
	Date: 11 March 2015
	
	Architect’s Instruction No. 12
	
	We received your Architect’s Instruction No. 12 on 9 March 2015 clarifying the capacity of water pumps for the fire hydrant system.
	
	With reference to the site progress meeting held on 5 March 2015 (last Thursday), we put on record that the concreting work for the fire services pump room was scheduled to be carried out on 13 March 2015 and your A.I. No. 12 will cause significant time and cost implications to the progress of the works.
	
	We write to serve you a written notice that since we have already placed the order for the fire services pumps based on the pump capacity specified in the bills of quantities, we have to re-procure the pumps according to your belated instruction and we shall likely incur direct loss and/or expense, including but not limited to the abortive works, as the progress of the Works is likely to be delayed or disrupted. The same also applies to the provision of the sprinkler system.
	
	We are yet to determine the exact time and cost implication and we will notify you in due course.
	
	Yours faithfully  
	For and on behalf of  
	BEST BUILD CONSTRUCTION

Before the next project meeting tomorrow afternoon with the Employer, the Architect would like to have your advice on the following by an email:

1. Apart from the architectural aspects in regard to the design changes for an elderly center, what other possible building services works or associated builder’s works would be included in the cost estimate for such a design change.
2. Would the Contractor be entitled to the claims as stated in their letter dated 11 March 2015? Please state the contract provisions based on which you have provided your advice to the Architect.

[15 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Design changes for elderly centre
	- Addition & alteration of sprinkler system
	- Revise sprinkler pump capacity for the likely increase in sprinkler head requirements
	- Additional pipe sleeves between walls and slabs
	- Electrical provisions for additional pipe fittings along the additional sprinkler pipework
	- Separate automatic fire alarm system for each floor
	- Visual fire alarm installation
	- Provisions for kitchen, laundry, toilets and bathing facilities, including hot water and gas provision
	- Call bell system
- Claims entitlement due to the design changes for elderly centre
	- The design changes for the elderly centre are likely to be substantial on level 3 & 4. However, whether they are critical enough to affect the whole of the Works would need further investigation. This would include an investigation of whether the concreting work for the fire services pump room would need to be carried out on 13/3, the implication of its postponement, the prospect of alternative construction sequence, etc. The time required for BD amendment submission may be an important factor. If the design changes are found to be critical, EOT would be required under clause 25.1(3)(h) and loss and expense compensation under clause 27.1(2)(c) for this Variation.
- Claim entitlement due to the clarification of pump capacities
	- Pursuant to clause 2.4, Contractor is obliged to inform the Architect if he finds any ambiguity or discrepancy among Contract Doc, including those found between Drawings and Bills. Architect shall issue an instruction to resolve the discrepancy as soon as practicable after receipt of the notice from Contractor, and such an instruction shall require a Variation as appropriate.
	- In the present case, the Architect has clarified that Contract Drawings should be followed and Contract Bills were incorrect. According to clause 14.1, the quality and quantity of the work included in Contract Sum shall be deemed to be that which is set out in the Contract Bills. If the Contract bills were incorrect and require correction, the Contract Sum should be adjusted as well. Cl.14.3(2) provides that the correction of an error in Contract Bills shall be deemed to be a Variation. It does not matter that the contract drawings were correct, because according to cl.5.1(2)(a), for the purpose of adjusting the Contract Sum, the Contract Bills shall take precedence over the contract drawings and spec.
	- The cost effect of Variation should be the cost difference between the different pump capacities, which may be an increase or a decrease depending on the change.
	- However, the Contractor is claiming for the cost of ordering based on the Contract Bills. Since the Contractor has already issued a RFI pending reply, he should wait for the reply and should not have placed order before the reply. Therefore, the abortive cost of ordering should be borne by himself.
	- Whether the ordering of the correct pumps following Architect's clarification would constitute a delay would depend on whether the subsequent installation is critical to the completion of the Works. This has yet to be investigated. If this does constitute a critical delay, EOT would be required under cl.25.1(3)(f) and loss and expense compensation under cl.27.1(2)(a) for correction of errors. However, since pumps are usually installed at the later stage of building construction, it is unlikely to be critical at this point in time. Furthermore, the design change for the elderly centre may have more substantial critical effect than this.

#Variation #Payment 
## Question

Question No. 4 – Interim Payment

Evergreen Ltd. Is the Main Contractor who has entered into a Contract with the Employer for the construction of a residential development and you are the project quantity surveyor of the appointed consulting quantity surveying firm.

The Contractor has just submitted an application for interim payment. As part of the application, the Contractor applied for a payment in the sum of $694,300 for the addition of 50m2 “ABC” brand folding partition to the multi-function room of the club house. The installation has been completed and passed the relevant testing and commissioning last week. There is no contract rate applicable for valuing that variation and the Contractor provided a build-up of the claimed amount as follows:

![[Pasted image 20250409091516.png]]

The Project Manager queried the reasonableness of the way in which the star-rate is derived and would wish to have your opinion on the matter.

Besides, the Project Manager finds that the safety measures provided by the Contractor are unsatisfactory and requests you to deduct 10% of the gross value of work done from the payment valuation so as to press the Contractor for improvement of the site safety.

You are required to draft an email to the Project Manager advising how the aforementioned items should be responded in the valuation of the interim payment.

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Star rate item: mark-up for profit and overheads
	- The 15% mark-up for profit and overhead is usually regarded as an industry norm without contest. 
	- It is probably originated from a provision in SFBC 2005 which allows 15% mark-up on daywork labour, materials and plant, which is only applicable to variations valued on daywork basis and the markup should be on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant, not on sub-contractor's price.
	- However, C would usually treat this as a mark-up over every tier of sub-contracting. This would end up in this case with 32.25% mark-up on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant, which would hardly be justifiable in a competitive market.
	- In principle, the level of profit and overheads should be in line with those used in building up the contract rates. However, it is usually difficult to prove what the level is and 15% is usually adopted as a convenient norm. 
	- Again, that mark-up is historically to be on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant, but this has ignored the fact that there are usually multi-level sub-contracting. Each level would need to have some mark-ups for its profits and overheads. It would mean that the 15% would have to be shared by the Contractor and all levels of sub-contractors. This may not be a problem when daywork is involved because the extent is generally small and the sub-contractor's foremen may count himself as a worker for daywork labour, but may not be in line with reality for normal work. The sub-contractors would also need profit and overheads. On the other hand, since the level of overheads service demanded from the sub-contractors should be smaller than that from the Contractor, their mark-ups should be smaller, and, with the assistance of sub-contractor, the MC's mark-up should also become smaller.
	- A reasonable mark-up level for profit and overheads should be judged based on the nature of the work and the prevailing market conditions rather than raking a stated percentage from a contract clause out of its context.
	- Unreasonable number of levels of sub-contracting should not be entertained.
- Deduct payment for unsatisfactory safety measures
	- SFBC do not have provision for deduction from Contractor's payment in respect of unsatisfactory site safety measures over the uncompleted value of site safety measures.
	- For government projects, the site safety measures have always been included as provisional items and the Contractor will get payment for those items if the Contractor did carry out or provide site safety measures according to the Contract requirements.
	- For private projects, similar provisional items may not be provided and the site safety measures would normally be included in the preliminaries. If the Contractor does not implement the site safety measures satisfactorily, the A / QS may take this into account in assessing the progress payment of the relevant preliminaries item in the valuation but may not deduct payment in the manner as requested by PM.

#Estimate 
## Question

Question No. 1 -- Cost Estimate

You are a team leader of a QS consultant firm. The Project Manager of a private developer, ABC Company Limited, just approached your firm to seek cost advice on an acquisition of land for residential use. The deadline for the submission of the land bid is just a few days later.

The Project Manager said they knew well about the selling prices of flats in this region, which was around $13,000/square foot, in terms of gross floor area (GFA). For assessment of the land cost affordability, he requested your firm to provide a preliminary estimate on the construction costs.

A development brief has been provided by the Project Manager for the preparation of the preliminary estimate. (Refer to Annex A to this Question.)

Your director then requested you to prepare a 1-page cost summary at current price level for his comment by tomorrow morning. The estimate should be broken down into the following:.

(a) Site investigation  

(b) Demolition and hoardings ##

(c) Foundations (based on bored piles average 40m deep)  

(d) Excavation and lateral supports (based on 273mm diameter pipe piles and assuming grout curtain not required; strutting and shoring 600kg/m2 on strutting areas)  ##  

(e) Basement screen wall, wearing slabs and waterproofing 

(f) Substructure  

(g) Superstructure  

(h) External works and drainage
	- External paving and landscaping works including Podium Garden and Outdoor Swimming Pool ##  
	- Underground drainage
	- Utility connections

(i) Contingencies

For those items with ##, he requested for further back-up calculations for his comment.

For the superstructure, your director asked you to make reference to a similar project being handled by your firm. The superstructure unit costs per construction floor area (CFA) are as follows:.

- Carpark: $9,000/m 2 CFA
- Sky Garden: $18,000/m 2 CFA
- Residential Podium (Lobby & Main Entrance): $35,000/m2 CFA  
- Residential Tower: $26,000/m 2 CFA
- Clubhouse: $40,000/m2 CFA

(All unit costs above include preliminaries and have been adjusted to the current price level, i.e. September 2016)

Your director also asked you to estimate separately the inflationary allowance for the following contract package:

![Pasted image 20250409092010|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250409092010.png)

Your firm's database indicated that the anticipated construction inflation for the coming 5 years would be 3% per annum.

Please respond with a covering memo.

## Question

Question No. 2 -- Incorporating Contractor's Design into Tender / Milestones & Liquidated Damages

You are the project quantity surveyor of a QS consultant firm. You have already prepared the tender documents for a twenty-storey industrial building development (including foundation works) and the complete set of the tender documents have been sent to the Employer for review and comment..

**Part A**

Now before the tender invitation, the Employer just had a meeting with you and the Project Team. During the meeting, the Employer would like to include an additional provision in the tender documents allowing the Contractor to propose his own design for the foundation works.

As your tender documents have been prepared on the basis of the foundation works to be designed by the Engineer, the Project Team would like you to advise on the following:

1. What additional information and requirements should be included in the tender documents with regard to the provision of Contractor's design for the foundation works?
2. What factors should the Project Team consider when assessing the acceptability  of a tenderer's foundation design?.

Please respond with a letter to the Architect with copies to others.

**Part B**

To implement a tighter control over the progress of the Works, the Employer would like to set out a schedule of milestone dates requiring the Contractor to meet. The Employer would like to know:.

1. whether a failure to meet the milestone dates on an agreed construction programme can make the Contractor liable for delay damages;
2. whether it is advisable to specify in the tender documents the milestone dates with rates of liquidated and ascertained damages for failure to meet the milestone dates; and
3. whether there are any other measures to discourage the Contractor from missing the milestone dates.

Please respond with an email to the Employer.

## Assessor Notes

- Alternative D&B offer
	- Additional information and requirements in Tender Doc
		- Two FOT - one with foundation works based on Engineer's design and one with foundation works based on Contractor's design, for filling in the respective tender sums and contract periods
		- Performance specification for foundation works including scope of the works, requirements for statutory submission and fitness for purpose (life time warranty, independent checking engineers and professional liability insurance)
		- Soil investigation report
		- Loading schedule
		- Provisions to bundle affected work together so as to prevent the Contractor from exploiting savings in foundation design at the expense of other work, e.g. pile caps
		- Provisions requiring tenderers to submit their design proposals together with following relevant information:
			- Experience and expertise in foundation design
			- Preliminary foundation design proposal (including implications on the pile cap design)
			- Method statement for the foundation works
			- Price breakdown for the foundation works
			- Overall design and construction programme
		- More tendering time should be allowed for tenderer to prepare design proposal
		- Consider fall back solution if Contractor's design cannot obtain statutory approval
			- Contractor to revise design at own cost and absorb lost time
			- Use Engineer's design if allowed by contract
	- Factors to be considered for assessment
		- Cost saving as compared to the Engineer's design, including the cost implications of pile caps
		- Time to complete as compared to the Engineer's design with due allowance for design and statutory submission
		- Technical merits including suitability for use on this particular site and possibility of getting statutory approval
		- Environmental impacts such as smock and noise
		- Safety requirements such as vibration and settlement
		- Tenderer's experience and expertise in design foundation works
		- Tenderer's financial capacity to take risks
- LAD and milestone dates
	- Failure to meet milestone dates on an agreed construction programme
		- Cannot make the Contractor liable for delay damages because he is free to plan his works to meet the Contract Completion Date or Sectional Completion Date only
	- Specify LAD for milestone date in Contract
		- To be entitled to delay damages for the Contractor's failure to meet the milestone dates, the Employer must have such entitlement specified in the Contract. However, it is unlikely that a milestone can be agreed after the award of the Contract with liability for delay damages but without reciprocity 互惠 benefits to the Contractor.
		- Specifying the milestone dates with rates of LAD would have the following advantages:
			- Meeting the milestone dates would become the Contractor's commitment
			- Failure to meet a milestone date would entitle the Employer to LAD
			- LAD are more convenient to the Employer than general damages which require proof
			- Rate of LAD offer certainty to the Contractor when pricing his tender
		- A special contract clause would need to be drafted
		- However, conducting a genuine estimate of LAD for failure to meet a milestone date is difficult, if no impossible, due to the following reasons:
			- In the case of milestone without involving handover to parties other than the Contractor, it is difficult to identify and estimate the loss and expense. The likely types of the loss and expense must be made known to the tenderers in order for the loss and expense to be accepted as within the contemplation of the Contractor to quality for compensation as damages
			- Multiple LAD for different milestone dates could add up to an amount extravagant to be a genuine estimate of the potential loss and expense due to delay to Contract completion
			- There may not be any loss and expense at all after missing a milestone dates if the Contractor can catch up the delay in the end
		- Care must therefore be exercised in estimating and specifying the rates of LAD otherwise they may be regarded as penalties and rendered unenforceable.
	- Other measures to encourage meeting milestone dates
		- Draft a clause in the Contract to the effect that the Employer is entitled to withhold a stipulate sum from interim payments for failure to meet a milestone date but the sum is refundable to the Contractor upon Contract completion subject only to the usual LAD or refundable whenever he can catch up the progress in any subsequent milestone.
		- Make the payment terms contingent upon the achievement of the milestone dates, i.e. payment not yet due when a milestone date is not yet achieved. This may give a better impression than withholding a stipulated sum from a payment otherwise due, though the essence is the same.
		- Introduce a bonus scheme incentivizing the Contractor to meet the milestone dates.
		- In all above cases, it is crucial that the special contract clause should also deal with:
			- EOT for achieving milestones due to any Employer's act of prevention of performance
			- The possibility of the criteria of a milestone not responsive to actual circumstances making the milestone not achievable, which would create undue hardship to the Contractor

## Question

Question No. 3 -- Tender Documentation

You are the QS consultant appointed by Diversity Recreation Club for the major renovation works in its club house. The consultant team is now preparing the tender documents for the Main Contract. To ensure quality, the Club decided that it will purchase directly a few items comprising mainly architectural finishes and fixtures for the Contractor to install under the Main Contract. However, the Club has not approached the suppliers yet (except for stone mentioned below). You are requested to advise the Club on how such an arrangement can be properly incorporated in the tender documents by highlighting the common issues and the corresponding information required.

Amongst these direct purchase items are the natural stone floor and wall finishes at the entrance lobby which the Club considers as a very important element in this renovation and will purchase. The Club is now negotiating the price with the supplier. You are requested to advise the Club on what specific information should now be confirmed with the supplier for incorporation into the tender documents for the Main Contract so as to avoid potential argument in the future.

The Club would also like to leave an option for the tenderers to negotiate directly with the supplier for a complete supply and installation package as part of the Main Contract provided that the stone must fully comply with the specification requirements.

Please write some notes in table form or bullet points for joint review by the Club and the designer in a meeting later today.

		- Sample / mockup for inspection during supplier selection stage
- Options for "fix only" and "supply and fix"
	- To enable the tenderers to quote for "fix only" and "supply and fix", there should be separate sections in the tender documents for the tenderers to price, probably treating "fix only" as the basic option and "supply and fix" as the alternative option.
	- To ensure that the tenderers will choose the selected supplier in case of "supply and fix", the simplest method is to:
		- Negotiate with the supplier to obtain a quotation agreeable to Employer but not yet formally accepted
		- Include the supplier's quotation with all the details in the tender documents for the tenderers to negotiate and conclude the terms with the supplier
		- Include a declaration that apart from the material and performance specification, all other contractual or commercial terms contained in the quotation are sole matters between the tenderers and the supplier
		- Require the tenderers to state the name of the supplier chosen by him
		- Compare the "fix only" and "supply and fix" rates to verify that the price difference is compatible with the supply prices known and with allowance for the Contractor's other costs and mark-ups
	- If it is permitted that the tenderers can propose other suppliers supplying the same materials, it should be so stated.
	- If it is intended to secure the chosen supplier and his prices before including his quotation in the tender document, some kind of written understanding should be reached with the supplier to the effect that his offer is a fixed standing offer acceptable by the Employer or by the future Contractor.
	- Execution of a sales contract followed by a novation agreement involving the Employer, the supplier and the Contractor is possible but should be used as the last resort because of the complication.
	- If it is necessary to secure the supplier earlier for example in order to secure the quarry, the price or earlier fabrication, then the fix only option should be adopted.

## Question

Question No. 4 -- Tendering Arrangement

A renowned international banking institution (the Employer) has directly appointed you as the Consultant Quantity Surveyor for a project to build a commercial building in Hong Kong as its flagship headquarters in Asia. The Employer's representative has made it clear that the Employer will only want to have highly capable contractors to undertake the construction of this building, and would want you to advise him on:.

1. The appropriate tendering arrangement to invite only highly capable contractors to tender.
2. How to proceed to select these contractors to tender.
3. How to ensure that the selected contractors will not withdraw from tendering after accepting the invitation to tender or withdraw their offers after they have submitted their tenders..

Please respond with a letter to the Employer.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Appropriate tendering arrangement
	- Selective tendering or negotiated tendering where only the most capable contractors will be invited to tender should be used in lieu of open tendering where incapable contractors may also submit a tender
	- Selective tendering will have the benefit of ensuing price competitiveness when compared with negotiated tender
	- The same can apply whether the contract is to be based on lump sum, remeasurement, cost plus or management contracting. The choice between these contractual arrangements would depend on a combination of design, programme and pricing considerations, but would be less relevance as far as selection of the most capable contractors is concerned.
- Selection of contractors to tender
	- Process
		- Compiling a list of capable contractors recommended by the project team based on their past experience, subject to the approval by Employer
		- Sending out general information of project to the approved list of capable contractors to invite their expression of interest with submission of their pre-qualification information
		- Evaluating the submitted pre-qualification information to short-list the best, adopting a scoring sheet to facilitate comparison
	- General information of the project should contain project location, type, scope, size, programme, Employer, project team, expected tendering date, contract type, etc.
	- Pre-qualification information may include
		- An introduction to the capability of the contractor like technical expertise, manpower resources, construction plant and equipment available, financial capability
		- An introduction to the company business stating the key areas of business and track record of clients 
		- Track record of previously completed projects preferably prestigious ones and with recommendation letters from previous employers or design teams
		- Any locally recognized awards on previous projects regarding the quality and construction of the works
		- Company's organization chart and CV of key staff
		- Proposed site team for the works with CV to show their expertise
		- Current workload and status of work completion
		- Any litigation or dispute cases convicted or remaining to be resolved in the past 5 years or a certain period of time
		- Status of licensing or registration with Government or statutory bodies or utilities companies
		- Safety record and safety operation manual
		- Quality check system for monitoring the construction works
		- Environmental protection measure
		- Sub-contracting arrangement and monitoring of sub-contractor's works
		- Successful cooperation with high end sub-contractors in delivery of high quality projects
		- Use of BIM of work coordination and clash detection before putting works into construction
		- Contact details
- Measure to minimize possibility to decline
	- Tenderers' declining to tender
		- Enquire prospective tenderers before tendering for expression of interest in tendering
		- Provide more information of project and contract during the enquiry to enable the prospective tenderers to make decision to tender
		- Do not include usually harsh contract terms
		- Give advice of no prejudice to future tendering prospect if declining the invitation
		- Given warning of bad records if declining to tender after accepting the invitation
		- Tenderers to give early reply if they really cannot tender after invitation
		- Give sufficient length of tendering period
		- Do not require tenderers to incur excessive tendering costs such as requiring them to measure BQ for complex projects
		- Require higher tender deposites which will be forfeited if genuine tenders are not submitted after collection of the tender documents
		- Include sufficient number of tenderers just in case some may decline
	- Tenderer's withdrawing tenders
		- Tender information to be kept strictly confidential to avoid leakage of information
		- Bid bond to be submitted
		- Deposit by tenderers of cash security, in lieu of a bid bond
		- Tender as a firm standing offer which cannot be withdrawn, possibly with a nominal consideration given by the Employer, e.g. one-dollar consideration
		- Tender negotiation changing the original tender requirements to be avoided as it may amount to a counter-offer which may invalidate the bid bond or firm standing offer
		- Tender assessment period to be kept as short as possible

#Defect 
## Question

Question No. 1 -- Contractor's Obligation for Rectifying Defects

In a project handled by you as the consultant Quantity Surveyor, signage boxes were required at the indoor pool area in accordance with a contract drawing titled "Indoor Pool Signage Box - Design Intent' which showed the overall dimension and the outlook of the signage boxes, and a remark which reads:

"The signage boxes shall be constructed of stainless steel and 'Perspex' panel complete with 'Superlight brand: Model No. 1200' LED light bars."

The relevant description in the contract bill of quantities reads:

"Design to approval, supply and install stainless steel signage boxes overall size 410mm wide x 60mm high with and including 3mm thick Perspex' panel; all supporting frames and hangers; all necessary accessories, fixing screws, painting, etc.; complete with 'Superlight brand: Model No. 1200' LED light bars, including submitting shop drawings for the Architect's approval."

The contract specification only contains the usual materials and workmanship clauses.

The Contractor prepared shop drawings for the signage boxes. The Architect approved them. The Contractor manufactured and installed the signage boxes in accordance with the approved shop drawings. However, one month after the completion of the construction works, it was discovered that, due to moisture ingress, the signage boxes could not function properly.

The Architect is investigating the true cause of the problem, but would like to have your advice on who should bear the cost of rectifying the defective signage boxes if the cause belongs to one of the following types:

(a) Poor workmanship not conforming to the Specification;  
(b) Inadequate design in developing the details; or.  
(c) Inappropriate selection of materials.

The Architect strongly believes that his approval of the shop drawings would not reduce the Contractor's responsibility. He considers that the Contractor should have anticipated during design development, if not during tendering, that the indoor pool area would be humid.

Please respond with a letter to the Architect including giving 5 possible technical solutions to the problem.

[The words "technical solutions' in the last sentence shall mean practical solutions or mitigations OTHER THAN contractual solutions.]

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Due to poor workmanship
	- Contractor is liable, and Architect may, under SFBC cl.8.3 issue AI to Contractor requiring rectification of defective works. The Architect's approval of shop drawings is not relevant
- Due to inadequate design
	- The Contractor's responsibility will, under SFBC cl.21.1(2), be limited to exercising reasonable skill and care unless the requirement of fitness for purpose is specifically stated.
	- It is not apparent from contract drawings, BQ and specification that there is a requirement of fitness for purpose. The Architect has to decide whether the Contractor has exercised reasonable skill and care.
	- It may be considered that even if there is no requirement of fitness for purpose, exercising reasonable skill and care should also take note of the humid environment of the indoor pool area. The Contractor should therefore be liable.
	- On the other hand, the Contractor may argue that the standard of reasonable skill and care should be that of the average competent professional design, he has attained this standard, otherwise the shop drawings would not have been approved by the Architect. This is not contrary to the general rule that Architect's approval of the shop drawings would not reduce Contractor's responsibility. It would therefore be difficult for Architect to hold Contractor liable. The cost of rectifying defects will have to be borne by Employer. 
- Due to inappropriate selection of materials
	- It should be further investigated whether the inappropriate materials are selected by the Contractor or Architect. 
	- Under SFBC cl.8.1(2), the materials selected by Contractor must be fit for purpose. However, it should be noted that "materials selected by Contractor" referred to in the said clauses should not include the specified stainless steel, panels, and LED light.
- Possible solution
	- Check whether there was any misuse such as spraying of water while playing or cleaning
	- Move sign boxes away from water sources or air-conditioning or heating outlets
	- Eliminate source of humid by proper ventilation of the indoor pool area
	- Avoid change of room temperature within a short time to avoid condensation of water
	- Avoid to use metal which may cause humid to condense easily
	- Coat or insulate metal surface so as not to retain condensate water
	- Eliminate design which may trap condensate water inside the sign boxes
	- Use waterproof electrical components 
	- Eliminate electrical components and use external lighting

## Question

Question No. 2 - Ambiguities in Contract Documents

You are the consultant Quantity Surveyor under a building contract. The form of contract is a lump sum contract (without quantities) based on engineer's design. All the works are being carried out by a building contractor without any nominated sub-contract. At a recent site meeting, the Contractor raised an issue regarding the scope of works.

As per the Specification Preliminaries, construction of sump pit is listed as one of the items under the scope of the Works. The size and details of the sump pit are shown on one of the Contract Drawings. On that drawing, there is also a symbol of sump pump marked inside the sump pit with the capacity of the sump pump indicated. However, it appears that nowhere in the Contract mentions the specification of the sump pump.

The Contractor claimed at the site meeting that the provision of the sump pump falls outside the original scope of the contract works on the following grounds:

1. The Specification Preliminaries only mention the construction of sump pit but not the sump pump; and
2. The Technical Specification contains no information about the technical details and requirements of the sump pump.

The Architect noted however that rate and sum for sump pump were inserted in the Schedules of Rates. The Architect sought your opinion about the following:-

1. Your interpretation of the scope of works in light of the information given in the Contract Drawings, Specification and Schedule of Rates and the rationale behind your interpretation.
2. What should be the proper course of actions for the Contractor and the Architect to deal with ambiguities or discrepancies in the Contract Documents?
3. Assuming that the sump pump is concluded as excluded, can its rate and sum included in the Schedule of Rates be used for valuation of variations?

Please respond with a letter to the Architect.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Scope of works
	- For lump sum without quantities, the work included in the original contract sum shall cover those shown on the Contract Drawings and described in the Specification.
	- SP can only give a broad description of the scope of works and cannot list out each and every single item of work. The Contract Documents shall be read as a whole and taken to be mutually explanatory.
	- The symbol of sump pump on the Contract Drawings is not part of the standard legend usually give on drawings but was specificlly marked inside the sump pit with the capacity of the sump pump indicated. It should be sufficient to indicate the intention that a sump pump should be provided.
	- Sump pits by common understanding should be equipped wit sump pumps. There is no provision for NSC for pumping services. An average competent building contractor should have realized the need to include the sump pump in the scope of works and the tender sum. The fact that there are rate and sum in SOR indicates that the Contractor has the same understanding. Therefore, a reasonable conclusion should be that a sump pump of the indicated capacity was included in the scope of the works.
	- Although Technical Specification contians no other information about the technical detials and requirements of the sump pump, the sump pump is to be selected by the Contractor and should be fit for purpose. "Fit for purpose" does not mean the best. The Architect canont impose excessive requirements.
	- It may be argued that apart from the sump pump itself, the associated electrical work and control panels were not shown on the Contract Drawings or specifically priced in SOR and were therefore excluded. Without the associated electrical work and control panels, the sump pump cannot operate. Adopting the same test described for the sump pump above, it is reasonable to conclude when pricing for a sump pump, the costs of the associated electrical work and control panels being the indispensable ancillaries should also be considered.
- Ambiguities or discrepancies
	- The Contractor should immediately inform the Architect if he finds any amibuities or discrepancies within or between Contract Drawings and Specification.
	- The Architect should clarify any ambiguities or discrepancies and inform the Contractor.
	- In case of discrepancies, the Architect should determine, basing on the order of precedence of the Contract Documents, what should be deemed to have been included in the Contract Sum.
	- The Architect should clarify what he now really wants.
	- SFBC clause 2.4(1), 5.1(1), 5.1(2)
- Use rate for VO
	- Since this is a lump sum contract based on Drawings and Specification, the quantities in SOR do not form part of the contract, but the unit rates do form and can be used for pricing variations. 
	- Hence, the quantity of the sump pump in SOR cannot be deemed to be the quantity included in the Contract Sum. 
	- On the other hand, if it is concluded that the scope of works did not include the sump pump, its unit rate can still be used when a sump pump of the same capacity is added back.

## Question

Question No. 3 -- Defective Work / Omission of Work

You are the project quantity surveyor of the Contractor for the construction of a residential building.

**Part A**

During a recent site inspection during construction, the Architect observed that stains and scratches were found on the door handles installed at the bathroom doors. The Architect then issued an Architect's Instruction to the Contractor requesting for rectification or replacement of the defective door handles within seven calendar days, failing which the Employer would engage other persons to complete such rectification work.

Following receipt of the Architect's Instruction, your Project Manager has asked. You to provide views on whether the Architect is empowered to issue such an instruction in that manner.

Please respond with a memo to the Project Manager.

[6 marks]

**Part B**

In view of the slow progress of the Works, the Architect issued another Architect's Instruction to the Contractor deleting the external signage work.

Following receipt of the Architect's Instruction, your Project Manager has asked you to give advice on the following:

(a) Whether the Architect is empowered under the Contract to omit the work? (b) How should the omitted work be valued under the Contract? (c) Whether the Contractor is entitled to claim for loss of profit if the Employe employs others to carry out the external signage work.

Please respond with a memo to the Project Manager.

[8 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Empower to issue AI
		- The Architect may instruct the Contractor to rectify defects or remove and replace any materials, goods or work that are not in accordance with the Contract under SFBC cl.8.3(a)(b), 8.4.
		- The Contractor should first check whether the alleged defects are really defects. If they are damage caused by persons first whether the alleged defeects are really defects, e.g. separate contractors employed directly by the Employer, he should report to the Architect for resolution.
		- If the Contractor accepts that they are really defects, he should investigate whether the defects can be rectified without replacement or the door handles need to be replaced. He should agree with the Architect a rectification method at the minimum cost.
		- The supplier or sub-contractor causing the defects should be held liable. 
	- Time for comply with AI
		- After receiving the instruction, the Contractor should comply with the Architect's instruction as soon as practicable under SFBC cl.4.3(1)
		- "as soon as practicble" means that regards must be given to both technical possibility and practicality taking account of all relevant facts of the circumstances, e.g. the time required to order new replacement materials. The Contractor may, therefore, have a ground for challenging whether the stipulated time of 7 calendar days for completing the rectification is practicable.
	- Fail to comply with AI
		- If the Contractor fails to comply with the instruction within a reasonable time, the Architect may issue a notice reminding the Contractor to comply. Only if the Contractor does not begin to comply with AI within 7 calendar days under SFBC cl.4.3(3), may the Employer employer others to execute the work and make an appropriate deduction from the Contract Sum. Therefore, there should be an instruction followed by a notice. Employer has no right to engage others to carry out the rectification base on the instruction alone.
	- Other bonus
		- Under SFBC cl.4.3(3), if the Contractor disagrees that the Architect's Instructio is valid, he may within 7 days of receipt of that instruction require the disagreement to be resolved following the settlement of dispute cl.41. However, there is no time bar to raising the disagreement. The Contractor should more diplomatically write to the Architect to request for correction of AI. Only if the Architect refuses to correct that cl.41 needs to be used.
		- The Contractor should also argue that the stains and scratches on the door handle are minor defects which should not affect the certification of substantial completion.
- B
	- Empowered to omit
		- The Architect may issue instruction ordering variations which involve omission of work under SFBC cl.13.1.
		- Accordingly, the Architect is empowered to issue instruction to omit the external signage work.
	- Valuation of variation
		- The work omitted shall be valued based on the contract rate under SFBC cl.13.4(3).
		- Under SFBC cl.13.4(3)(b), a fair adjustment shall be made to the valuation of the work omitted, if the Contractor has reasonably incurred expense which has become wholly or partly unnecessary as a result of the omission of work.
		- Under SFBC cl.13.4(6), a fair adjustment shall be made to the rates for the remaining work, if the omission of work substantially changes the conditions under which the remaining work is carried out.
		- Omission of the external signage does not appear to warrant the above adjustment
	- Contractor's objection ground
		- Generally, contractors would not object to the omission of work unless the work is very profitable. However, the provisions for fair adjustments mentioned above would not help the contractors in this respect, even when the omission is intentional to avoid the high prices
		- A possible ground for objection is that the external signage work could have entitled the Contractor to EOT which can off-set the Contractor's own delay, but his entitlement will be lost due to the omission. However, SFBC does not have express provisions dealing with such situation. The argument would therefore need to be resolved with reference to the common law. In spite of this, there is no reason why the Contractor should not raise his objection with the Architect in order to protect his own interest.
		- Another possible ground for objection to the omission of work is where the work is essential to comply with statutory requirements, e.g. obtaining occupation permits. If this is the case, then it is an act of prevention on the part of the Employer or the Architect. The Contractor can object even if there is no express contract provision for objection.
		- It is a common law principle that the Employer cannot omit work for it to be carried out by others. If he does so, he will be liable to pay the Contractor the profit lost because of the omission. The purpose is to avoid the unfairness caused to the Contractor if the Employer picks the high price work and gives it to others at a cheaper price making an otherwise profitable job a loss to the Contractor.
			- SFBC cl.13.1(1)(b) expressly provides that the Contractor's written consent is required for an instruction regarding the omission of work in order for it to be carried out by others.
			- The Employer's omission may be genuine one because of budget constraint after many other variation additions. If he only employs others to carry out the external signage work long after the completion of the  Contract, then it may not be reasonable to apply the above common law principle.

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 4 -- Valuation of Variations

You are the in-house QS Manager employed by Dundee Investment Limited on a new build residential project. The Main Contract for the construction of the superstructure of the project was let based on bills of quantities. The Contractor recently submitted quotations following three Architect's Instructions (AI No. 10, Al No. 22 and Al No. 33). Dundee's Accounting and Finance Director is struggling to understand the logic of the Contractor's quotations and would like you to give comments by an email. Here are the key points raised by the Director who did not expressly state his queries. Detailed calculation of the variation amounts is not required at this stage.

- AI No. 10
	As shown on the Contract Drawings, the metal false ceilings at the ground floor Iobby comprises ceilings at 6m above floor (total 500m2) and 8m above floor (total 600m2). The Contract Bills measured 1,100m2. In accordance with this Al, the height of all the said ceilings (i.e. 1,100m2) was revised to 8m above the floor. Except for the ceilings, all other items (bulkheads, wall finishes, services, etc.) priced in the quotation associated with the revision to ceiling height appear reasonable. The contract rate for the ceilings is HK $1,000/m2.The Contractor submitted a revised rate of HK$2,000/m2 for all the ceilings. A clause in the special preambles to the Contract Bills however provides that ceilings exceeding 3.5m above the floor shall be grouped together and the rate shall be deemed to include for any ceiling height above floor.

- AI No. 22
	Under this Al, the Contractor was instructed to take delivery of loose furniture from the Employer's supplier at the site entrance and move the furniture to the ground floor lobby. The Contractor quoted 20 man hours priced at daywork rates provided in the Contract Bills. The number of man hours quoted seems reasonable. However, the Architect has pointed out that the work was actually done by several general labourers who were always employed on site for the full duration of the Contract period. The Architect therefore refused to confirm the time spent by the labourers.

- Al No. 33
	Under this Al, a 54mm diameter copper pipe of 50m long is added for water supply from plant room on ground floor to a water feature on podium. Apart from the pipe itself, the following items are priced in the quotation:
	
	Pipe fittings - bends.  
	Insulation to pipe.  
	Painting to pipe.  
	Connection of pipe to water pump Spares - pipe fittings.

Please respond with an email to the Director.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Preamble deemed to include all heights
	- Preambles only refer to those provided in the original contract, any change shall be variation.
	- BQ of 1100m2 ceilings comprise 500m2 at 6m high and 600m2 at 8m high. Because of different height, the costs of scaffolding, working platform, suspension system, and installation are all different for the two ceilings. The contract rate if $1000/m2 is only an average rate, being = (500m2 @ rate6 + 600m2 @ rate8)
	- SFBC 2005 cl.13.4(1)(ii) permits that if due to variations, the work affected is no longer carried out under the same or similar conditions, its contract rate can be reasonably adjusted. Therefore, adjustment of unit rate to the order of rate8 is reasonable and permissible.
	- Contractor is now quoting $2000/m2 which is equivalent to rate8, putting it back to the original quotation would mean rate6 = -200/m2, which is absurd. The Contractor should be requested to clarify and correct as appropriate.
	- If the suspension system is heavy steel frame, it is likely that rate8 would be cheaper than rate6 because the savings in the suspension system may be more than the cost increase to the scaffolding.
	- If the suspension system is light hanger rods, it is likely rate8 would be more expensive.

- VO using daywork rate done by general labourers always on site
	- The Contractor is primarily entitled to additional payment for work not originally included in the Contract.
	- If there are contract rates, the contract rates should be used. There are contract rates in the form of daywork rates. The daywork rates are reasonable applicable to the present case of labour only work, and should be used. Whether the daywork rates are very profitable or not is immaterial.
	- If there are no contract rates, the rates payable should be on fair market rates.
	- Whether daywork rates or fair market rates are to be used, the possible fact that the Contractor does not really have to spend extra money to use the general labour routinely standing-by is also immaterial. Objectively, spending time on moving the furniture would result in a loss of time on other work - a case of loss without expense.
- VO quotation have extra items
	- Variation should be measured according to the same standard method of measurement used to measure BQ. It should therefor be checked to see whether this is the case:
		- Pipe bends - Under HKSMM clause XVII(d)2, deemed to be included
		- Insulation to pipe - Normally not required for cold water supply pipes, but may be required to avoid condensation water. To be confirmed by A / E
		- Painting to pipe - Labelling is required. Painting may be required for exposed pipes. Pipes inside pipe ducts and above suspended ceiling is normally not painted. To be confirmed by A / E
		- Connection of pipe to water pump - Under HKSMM clause XVII(d)1, deemed to be included
		- Spares for pipe fittings - Pipe fittings are readily available in the market. The Contractor is normally not required in the Contract to purchase spares and hand them over to Employer. To be confirmed by A / E

## Question

Question No. 2 – Value Engineering

Your client is going to build a 12-storey multi-functional building on a vacant site. The total Construction Floor Area (CFA) is 30,000m2 with typical floor CFA of 2,400m2 . The new building comprises mainly lecture rooms, multi-purpose rooms, offices, a western restaurant, store rooms, etc.

You as the Consultant QS has just completed a Scheme Design construction cost estimate at HK $800M, which is 5% over the budget. Your client then requested the consultant team to give value engineering (VE) ideas to alleviate the cost overrun.

Your assistant attended the first VE meeting on your behalf with the client and the design consultants yesterday. The client requested your firm to firstly estimate the indicative cost saving of 5 VE ideas. Your assistant has finished the estimate and summarized as follows. His backup calculations are shown in Appendix A to this question.

![Pasted image 20250409093142|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250409093142.png)

You are required to review your assistant’s backup calculations and revise the cost estimate if appropriate. More importantly, you should prepare estimating notes, assumptions or record of queries made so that you can be more certain about the scope of changes. For the avoidance of doubt, you are NOT required to comment on the aesthetical, functional or statutory aspects of the VE ideas or propose any new VE ideas in your answer. It would be acceptable to directly mark on the question paper.

## Assessor Notes

- VE1 - structural reinforced concrete columns
	- Formwork - apart from the unit rates, the quantity of formwork will change. 
	- Concrete - similar to formwork, the volume of concrete will change
	- Reinforcement - the reinforcement designs of round columns and square columns are different. SE should advise on the difference. At scheme design stage, it is acceptable to apply the same reinforcement ratio
	- Finishes to columns - quantity and unit rate will change. The rate for circular wall finishes liking cladding and tiles should be higher than those for flat wall finishes
	- Cost implication of other building elements, e.g. concrete shoulders of different mixes, floor finishes, ceiling finishes, building services can be considered relatively insignificant
- VE2 - atrium glass skylight
	- The unit rate for skylight with structural frame is approximately HK$15,000/m2. This is considered reasonable for a typical glass skylight.
	- In addition to the omission of glass skylight, interfacing details such as cubs and joints between the glass skylight and adjacent structure and finishes could also be omitted.
	- The unit rate for the green roof is too low. The structure supporting the green roof is apparently missing. It can be reinforced concrete or steel.
	- Waterproofing, insulation, roof finishes, and ceiling finishes should be added back. 
	- Review rate of green roof system (soil and paint) and associated irrigation system.
	- Bonus for considering design changes to lighting and building services installation
- VE3 - western restaurant on G/F
	- The relocation of dining area from indoor to outdoor can only mean a change of use, not necessarily a reduction of CFA. A change of use without reduction of CFA would not save a lot and there would be extra cost to provide the dining area outdoor. It is therefore not appropriate to report any cost saving without further descriptions of the actual changes, as evidenced by records of clarification with the design consultants and the client. 
		- Reduction or not of CFA, stating the new use if CFA is not to be reduced
		- Reduction of extent or standard of IFO to indoor dining area
		- Reduction of extent or standard of M&E provisions to indoor dining area
		- Addition of canopy, umbrellas or similar covering outdoor dining area
		- Upgrading of indoor furniture to outdoor weatherproof furniture
		- Downgrading of the outdoor furniture to simpler style
		- Revision of external area to accommodate outdoor dining
		- Addition of outdoor lighting
		- Addition of outdoor ventilation and heating
		- Modification of facade design to allow for more open access between indoor and outdoor
- VE4 - BOH false ceiling
	- Arithmetical error
	- Typically, with false ceiling, fire sprinklers are installed at the soffit of false ceiling and inside ceiling void. With the omission of the false ceiling, ceiling void fire sprinklers and associated pipework, fittings, etc should also be omitted.
	- Similar to above, ceiling void smoke detectors and associated wiring, control, etc should be omitted
	- Wall finishes to the exposed ceiling void should be added back
	- Painting to building services at the exposed ceiling void might be required
	- Plastering and painting to concrete ceilings and beams should be added back. The area on plan plus 10-20% addition for sides of beams would be reasonable assumption. Having said that plastering may be ignored to reduce cost.
	- The type of lighting fittings and fixing method will change
	- If air conditioning is provided at BOH area, its loading will increase due to the omission of false ceiling
- VE5 - transformer
	- The transformer itself is supplied and installed by the electricity supply company. However, a service charge is normally paid by the client to the electricity supply company, and could be reduced.
	- Reduction in the cost of main switchboard and rising mains
	- Possible reduction of CFA due to the reduction in size of the transformer room, or a change of use. Record the queries raised with the design consultants about the changes.
	- Reduction of associated builder's works e.g. cable trench, ventilation, louvre, lighting, etc in the transformer room
- Corresponding changes to prelim and contingencies
	- State if ignore

## Question

Question No. 3 – Tender Price Index

Your consultant QS firm publishes Tender Price Index (TPI) quarterly in its publication. The Project Manager of one of your developer clients has observed that the percentage increase in the unit construction cost per Construction Floor Area (CFA) of residential developments is significantly higher than the corresponding percentage increase in your company’s TPI in the past decade, which casts doubt on the accuracy of your company’s TPI.

Please draft a letter to the Project Manager explaining:

(a) the purposes and limitations of the TPI; and  
(b) why there is a deviation between the percentage changes in the residential unit construction cost and the TPI.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Purpose and limitation
	- TPI are often compiled by government departments and QS consultants based on data collected from tenders. The targeted sector varies from index series to index series. Indices complied by government departments often focus on public works while indices complied by QS consultants often focus on private sector. Most of the TPIs published by QS consultants measure tender price movements of a fixed quantified list of notional builder's works items which are typical to building construction projects, and may exclude certain building elements, e.g. piling, substructures, external works and mechanical & electrical services
	- Factors reflected by TPI
		- General fluctuations of common materials, labour and plant costs
		- Trend of risks allocation between contractors and employers
		- Competition among contractors
	- However, since the quantified list is fixed, TPIs generally do not reflect changes in design standards and provisions of the building occurring after the Base Year of the respective index in response to the property market.
	- Even if TPI has been compiled very responsive to changes in the design standards and provisions, a single TPI covering all building types would only represent the weighted average of all building types. Because of the different choices of design standards and provisions, the unit construction costs of different building types are different, and the changes of the unit construction costs of different building types over time are different. Some unit construction costs will change more rapidly than the averaged TPI while other unit construction costs will fall behind.
	- TPI is just an aid to indicate the general average trend of tender price level changes of all building types. It would be useful to serve as an economic indicator and for making minor adjustment due to change in time to costs already estimated on a more solid basis for estimating purposes. TPIs are based on historical tender prices which trend may not necessarily apply to the future.
	- Even the unit construction cost for a particular building type is also an average of that particular building type, and should not directly be applied to a particular building
	- The actual cost of a building will depend upon the design, site conditions and many other factors relevant to that particular building. The more solid cost estimate should be based on the building itself rather than relying on the published TPI or unit construction cost for that building type.
- Reason for residential unit construction cost rising more rapidly than the TPI 
	- Increasing tendency of developers uplifting the design standards and provisions of private residential buildings in the past decade:
		- Increased floor-to-floor height
		- Adoption of curtain wall system and glazed screen
		- Heavy use of natural stone finishes
		- Luxurious provision of kitchen appliances
		- Luxurious provision of sanitary fittings and wares
		- Sophisticated clubhouse design, etc.
	- BEAM Plus certification
	- Mandatory implementation of Building Energy Codes
	- Enhanced fire services provisions required by latest Code of Practice / Circular Letters
	- Enhanced site safety, environmental management and site hygiene provisions

## Question

Question No. 4 – Contract Procurement

You are the project quantity surveyor of a consultant QS firm and are responsible for a proposed residential development in Wanchai (“the Project”). The Project is being procured using a traditional contractual arrangement under two separate contracts, namely, Foundations Contract and Superstructure Contract. The Foundations Contract has been tendered for, while the detailed design of the Superstructure Works is underway.

**Part A**

The tenderer submitting the lowest tender for the Foundations Contract has advised your Client that the overall construction cost and time can be reduced if the foundations and superstructure works are combined under one single contract and awarded to him.

You have been requested to address the following:

1. Benefits and drawbacks of combining the foundations and superstructure works into one contract at this juncture; and 
2. Issues to be resolved if the combined approach is to be adopted.

Please respond with a letter to the Client.

[6 marks]

**Part B**

The Client eventually awarded the Foundations Contract only. It is now three months before the completion of the foundation works. The tender drawings for the superstructure works (including M&E services and lifts) have been completed and your firm is preparing the Bills of Quantities for tendering in a single package within one month followed by two months’ tendering, analysis and award.

The Client has just decided to change the use of the development from residential to serviced apartment. The Engineer has advised that there would be no change to the foundation works. The Employer would want to commence the superstructure works immediately after the foundation works, and apply to the relevant Government departments for the change from residential to serviced apartment while the structure is being constructed. The structure will not be changed significantly. The lifts will also not be changed. The Employer is prepared to take the risk of the statutory approval process. The Employer would like you to advise him by a letter how to implement his idea in the imminent tendering exercise and the Tender Documents to ensure cost certainty, noting that there would not be sufficient time to revise all the detailed architectural and M&E drawings by the due day for issuing the Tender Documents but the general plans for the serviced apartment should be ready by then.

[6 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Benefits of one contract
		- Elimination of demobilization time by FDN and mobilization time by BLD after completion of the foundation works
		- Reduction of overall time due to more time overlap of the foundation works and superstructure works
		- Saving of some temporary protection measures otherwise required due to two contracts
		- Less interfacing problems when incorrect foundation works occurs and requires rectification
		- Undivided responsibility by one contractor
		- Possibility of deferring the design of part of the superstructure work otherwise required for tendering for the Superstructure Contractor
		- Possibility of using the Contractor's design and buildability input for the development of the superstructure design
		- Elimination of the time required to prepare full-blown Tender Documents and conduct tendering
	- Drawbacks of one contract
		- Design of superstructure works not yet completed for tendering
		- Tender Documents for the superstructure works not yet prepared
		- Competitive tender prices for the superstructure works not yet obtained
		- Deferment of the foundation works even if tendering for the superstructure now is possible 
		- Less price certainty and more arguments if the prices for the superstructure works are negotiated with the lowest foundation works tenderer based on schedule of rates or provisional quantities or cost-plus
		- No benchmark to judge whether the prices for the superstructure works would be cheaper
		- Increase of the time required to calculate and agree the prices during the post contract stage 
	- Issues to be resolved
		- Credibility, track record, technical and financial capabilities, statutory qualifications, etc of the lowest tenderer to be checked to ensure that he is capable and trustworthy and not just deceiving to secure more works
		- Drafting of specification and contract provisions to cover the superstructure works and to cover the later availability of the complete design
		- Possible inclusion of responsibility to provide Contractor's design input
		- Agreeing a pricing mechanism for the superstructure works, i.e. schedule of rates or  provisional quantities or cost and fee definitions and fee basis 
		- Finding a pricing benchmark such as past jobs with the same character
		- Setting a deadline to drop the idea and award FDN
- B
	- Write into the Tender Documents to clarify
		- Basis of the design and quantities used for tendering
		- That the works are to be commenced based on BD approval residential design initially
		- The programme for the availability of the construction drawings and BD approved drawings for the serviced apartment design after the commencement of the works
		- The extent that the Contactor has to accommodate in terms of time, cost and statutory compliance in case of a failure to obtain statutory approval or consent or a delay to the programme
		- The mechanism to evaluate the extra time and cost effects if the failure or delay is more severe than expected.
	- Keep measuring BQ exactly based on the present set of residential drawings to form a clear base for measuring the future change to serviced apartment
	- Produce (by A and E) additional specification for additional work items required for serviced apartment
	- Produce (by A and E) typical details for additional work items required for the serviced apartment
	- Prepare a SOR (or provisional BQ) to represent the additional work items to obtain rates for future pricing of variations
	- Include a cost-plus mechanism to cover major items not coverable by SOR or provisional BQ
	- Include the aforesaid into the Tender Documents and update where appropriate by means of tender addenda or post tender clarifications until contract award
	- Monitor the cost of the serviced apartment design during its development
	- Measure, value and agree the variations as soon as the construction drawings for the serviced apartment are issued.

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 1 – Valuation of Variations

You are a Project Team Leader of a Consultant QS firm. Your assistant Peter, the Project Quantity Surveyor for a residential project (“the Project”), disapproved of the Contractor’s practice which applied a mark-up of 25% on every item of work involving a variation indiscriminately. The mark-up comprises 15% for profit & overheads and 10% for site preliminaries.

The type of contract for the Project is a lump sum contract with Bills of Quantities. Peter considers that no mark-up as such shall be applied in accordance with the valuation rules for variations stipulated in the Contract.

The Contractor disagreed with Peter and argued that every piece of work ordered by variation instructions (or orders), regardless of whether it is valued by applying the rates in the Bills of Quantities or valued at fair rates, would necessitate extra expenses in respect of additional head office resources and site preliminaries provisions. The Contractor cited certain practical happenings like, overtime for site QS to prepare the quotations for the variations, more supervision workload for superintendents, more frequent visits by project director. The Contractor, however, did not argue for delays and disruptions due to the variations.

The matter has been escalated to you for advice. Please express your views in a memorandum to Peter to advise him and quote the relevant contract clause numbers whether you endorse his view or otherwise and the proper course of actions to be taken.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Applicable Contract provisions
	- Both Peter and Contractor's approaches are not entirely correct. The Contract provides a set of valuation rules for various situations, for some of which separate calculation of overheads and profit is allowable. 
	- Contract rate
		- Overheads and profit are deemed to have been included in the contract rates and prices according to HKSMM4. Items valued using or making reference to the contract rates should therefore have the same allowance for overheads and profit included automatically.
		- Contractors are free to allow for office overheads, site overheads and profit in the unit rates for the relevant measured work or in the preliminaries. Tender Documents usually stipulate that the preliminaries prices are fixed and would not be adjusted in case of variations to the measured works.
		- Contracts priced based on a set of fixed unit rates and prices usually stipulate that the contract rates should by default be used for pricing increases or decreases in quantities due to variations under SFBC cl.13.4(1)(a) to (c)(i) & (3)(a). No further mark-up for overheads and profit is admissible.
	- Pro-rata rate
		- If the variation addition is not of the same or similar character to or executed under the same or similar conditions to the original work, then the contract rates should still apply but adjustment can be made for the difference in characters or conditions under SFBC cl.13.4(1)(a) to (c)(ii). Therefore, only if the Contractor can demonstrate that the variation addition has caused him extra overheads over those reasonably anticipated at the time of tendering, then there can be additions for the extra overheads and related profit. The Contractor should substantiate such additional costs in details rather than apply an arbitrary mark-up percentage.
		- The happenings cited by the Contractors can apply to all variations, are therefore normal, and should therefore have been allowed for in the contract rates.
	- Fair valuation
		- Only if, due to different characters or conditions, the contract rates cannot reasonably serve as the base for valuation, then fair rates are to be used under SFBC cl.13.4(1)(c)(iii)
		- Fair rates derived from the first principles (cost plus overheads and profit) can take into account all reasonable costs (including extra site preliminaries) arising from the carrying out of the variation, and have a mark-up percentage to cover overheads and profit. The overheads can cover head office overheads and site overheads not allowed for in the preliminaries. It would be necessary to scrutinize that the site overheads allowed for in the mark-up do not overlap the site overheads allowed for in the costs. 15% is taken as the common norm for simplicity sake only. The Contractor may be required to demonstrate that the percentage is the same as that used to price his contract rates, to follow the principle that the price levels of the contract rates should still be applicable.
		- If the fair rates are determined by making reference to market rates, those rates should already have included for overheads and profit. Care should be taken when deciding whether further mark-up for the same would be made.
	- Daywork basis
		- If the variation work cannot be properly measured and valued, it can be valued on daywork basis under SFBC cl.13.4(2). The principle is the same as that described above for fair rates derived from the first principles. SFBC cl.13.4(2)(d)(iv) stipulates that the percentage for overheads and profit should be that included in the Contract, otherwise 15%.
- Proper course of actions
	- Give contract provisions and contractual interpretations to Contract for his reference
	- Request the Contractor, if he still disagrees, to explain in more details the contract provisions on which his claim for such mark-up is based
	- Request the Contractor to submit proof or record to substantiate that extra site overheads or head office overheads over the normal anticipation will be or have been incurred.
	- Review the assessment of the Contractor's claim in light of the above-mentioned
	- Request the Contractor to demonstrate the percentage mark-up for overheads and profit used in pricing his tender. Request where necessary for a copy of the audited accounts for the past 4 years to counter-check the head office overheads and profit percentages.

#Determination 
## Question

Question No. 2 – Determination of Contractor’s Employment

You are the Project Consultant QS for a residential project. During a monthly progress meeting, the Architect expressed his concerns about the progress of works as the prevailing programme revealed a 4 weeks’ delay. The Architect urged the Contractor to expedite the Works and asked the minutes taker to put it on record that if there is no sign of improvement within 14 days, he will formally recommend to the Employer to determine the Contractor’s employment.

14 days after the progress meeting, the Architect was still unsatisfied with the Contractor’s progress of works. He then wrote a letter to the Employer recommending determination of the Contractor’s employment and engagement of others to complete the remaining works.

The Employer is inclined to accept the Architect’s recommendation and asked for your view before deciding on any further action.

You are requested to write a letter to the Employer to advise him and quote the relevant contract clause numbers on the procedures to invoke determination and whether the 4 weeks’ programme delay is sufficient to do so.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Procedures
	- A default by Contractor as in cl.35.1(1)(a) to (e)
	- A notice of default served by Architect under cl.35.1(1) and in compliance with the requirements set out in cl.35.1(2) stating the default and with a clear warning of determination
	- A continuation of the default by Contractor for 14 days after receipt of the Architect's notice of default under cl.35.1(3)(a)
	- A certification by Architect of the same under cl.35.1(3)(b)
	- A notice of determination served by Employer pursuant to clause 35.1(3) within 14 days of the said Architect's certificate. Alternatively, a notice of determination may be served under clause 35.1(5) if the conditions mentioned in sub-clause (a), (b) and (c) are satisfied
	- Sending of all notices of default or determination by special delivery (cl.1.10)
	- Remind the Employer that a single wrong step in the determination procedures by the Employer may lead to the Employer himself being in repudiatory breach of the Contract. Therefore, the matter, timing and formality must be handled with extreme care.
- Sufficiency
	- Based on the give facts that the Contractor has an unsatisfactory progress of works, clause 35.1(a), (c), (d) and (e) are therefore irrelevant. The Architect is probably referring to the Contractor's failure to proceed regularly and diligently with the works under cl.35.1(1)(b).
	- However, a programme delay of 4 weeks does not by itself provide conclusive proof of a lack of due diligence
	- The programme may not have been updated for all kinds of delays (with or without extension of time entitlement) to serve as a realistic programme for monitoring
	- The 4 weeks' delay may be the result of accumulation over a long time and it is no longer feasible to catch up
	- The Contractor may have been working very regularly and diligently but because of site problems the progress has not been satisfactory.
	- Much more evidence is required such as:
		- Failing to achieve the programmed productivity because of inadequate resourcing
		- Diminishing resources without justifiable grounds
		- Actual resources deployed are far less than what were planned
	- The record in the minutes cannot serve as a notice of default under cl.35.1(1)
	- The procedures described above should be strictly followed in order to invoke determination
	- To conclude, none of the ingredients of a valid determination under the Contract has been established at this moment and it is pre-mature for the Employer to issue a notice of determination.

#EOT #Acceleration 
## Question

Question No. 3 – EOT & Time for Completion

You are the Project Consultant QS for a 30-month construction contract for a Sports Stadium in Kowloon East (“the Contract”). The Works were commenced on 1 June 2015 and the date for completion is 30 November 2017. The Sports Stadium has been designed to have a seating capacity of 50,000 to host international sports events such as important soccer and rugby matches as well as entertainment events like concerts and carnivals. The Sports Stadium is to be a modern and quality type and equipped with advanced stadium facilities such as retractable roof, 3-dimensional video wall, heating and cooling systems, etc.

**Part A**

Under the Contract, the retractable roof is to be designed by the Contractor in accordance with the requirements set out in Particular Specification Section 10 (Appendix A). On 1 October 2016 when the construction of the retractable roof was about to start on the site in 3 months, the Contractor submitted a detailed design in which the following major elements were proposed:
	“Roof structure: Structural steel complying with BS EN 10210; 4-hr FRP 
	Retractable arm: Electricity-operated hydraulic retractable arm  
	Roof panel: UV-reflective polycarbonate panel providing a Sun Protection Factor of 10 (SPF10) (Remarks: Plexiglass can only provide SPF5 maximum)”

On 31 October 2016, the Architect rejected the Contractor’s submission with the following comments:
	“Polycarbonate panels are prone to yellowing under prolonged sunlight and not ideal for stadium roof. Please re-submit by using Plexiglass despite it can only provide SPF5.”

During the Site Progress Meeting on 7 November 2016, the Contractor pointed out that the re-design and the material ordering of Plexiglass panels would take 3 months, thereby causing an overall delay of 1 month to the completion of the Works.

The Architect confirmed to proceed with Plexiglass panels registering the mutual disagreement to be resolved later.

The Architect has now asked for your opinion on whether the Contractor may have grounds for the claim for the delay. Please draft a memo to the Architect to advise him and quote the relevant contract clause numbers.

[8 marks]

**Part B**

It is early August 2017 now. The outstanding works are signalling, floodlighting, cooling and heating systems etc. Which are to be carried out in the next few months. The date for completion has now been extended to 30 December 2017.

During the Project Management Meeting yesterday, the Employer expressed his desire to take occupation of the stadium by the original date for completion, i.e. 30 November 2017, for the Asian Cup scheduled to be held in January 2018. In this respect, measures have to be taken to recover the delay for which an extension of time of 30 days has been granted previously.

The Architect enquired the Contractor if more workers could be deployed to accelerate the Works. The Contractor responded that he could only maintain the same number of workers but might arrange overtime working. He then submitted a delay recovery proposal as attached in Appendix B. The Architect has asked you to quickly check and email to advise him whether the proposal has any fundamental errors in the calculation principle. Please give him 5 points. Detailed adjustment of the proposal would not be necessary.

## Assessor Notes

- Variation and late instruction
	- Contractual grounds
		- The delay claim may be based on delays due to variation or late instruction
	- Variation
		- Identify the contract requirements for the roof panels and determine whether the Architect's reply constituted a variation under the Contract
		- The Particular Specification requires that the roof panels shall have SPF10. The Contractor's proposed polycarbonate panels are compliant in this regards. The yellowing consideration stated in the Architect's reply is not stated in the Particular Specification, but this may be the real issue to the Contractor. It should be the more expensive Plexiglass which is the real issue.
		- The preference for Plexiglass in the Particular Specification should not be interpreted as prevailing over the SPF10 requirement. If it is proven that Plexiglass does not have SPF10, then it would be reasonable for the Contractor not to have allowed for the more expensive Plexiglass. The Architect's request for using the more expensive Plexiglass should therefore be regarded as a variation under SFBC cl.13.1 which could entitled Contractor to EOT under cl.25.1(3)(h).
	- Late instruction
		- The Contractor may also argue that the instruction was late, which being given at 1 month after the Contractor's submission of design under SFBC cl.25.1(3)(f). 
		- However, it should be checked to see whether the submission of the polycarbonate design 3 months before work on site was early enough or too late. Reasonably, sufficient time should be allowed for the Architect's comment, at least one revision and re-submission, material ordering and off-site fabrication. The 3 months' period appears to be too short. If it is proven that the submission was late making the variation from polycarbonate to Plexiglass critical, then the delay caused by the variation should not be entitled to EOT.
		- Furthermore, the Contractor should have the duty to request for clarification over the ambiguity of contract requirement between SPF10 and Plexiglass prior to submitting its design under cl.2.4
- Valuation of delay recovery proposal
	- Daytime working with no increase in the number of workers or plant should not be an extra
	- For overtime work at higher pay, only the extra (i.e. after deduction of the normal payment with the same productivity) should be paid
	- The rate for overtime pay is excessive because of possible confusion in counting the mandays. Using the light mast erector as an example, the numbers of the works (and MD) working normal hours and working overtime are the same. It means that the MD is actually a headcount instead if the equivalent mandays. Paying 1 MD to a worker working 1800-2200 for 4 hours gross already means more than double pay. The rate per MD should not be increased from $1400 to $2100.
	- Provision of materials should not be an extra unless extra reserve has to be ordered
	- Why are there more signalling workers working overtime than daytime?
	- Only overtime pay should be treated as extras for supervisory personnel which are usually paid monthly salaries
	- Should check whether the Contract already requires 24-hour security guard service
	- There should be some savings in the payments to the supervisory personnel and security guards because of a reduction of the construction period. This also applies to overheads. In other words, the prolongation cost claim due to EOT should be waived.
	- Profit & overheads are admissible only if the other prices are costs without profit and overheads

## Question

Question No. 4 – Programme of Works

**Part A**

You are the Consultant Project QS for a project with a contract period of 36 months. In the 33rd month after the commencement of the Works, the Contractor submitted an EOT claim. After consideration, the Architect notified in writing to the Contractor of his decision that no EOT is to be granted. The Contractor subsequently submitted a programme with the anticipated completion date falling behind the currently extended time for completion. While the Architect verbally reminded the Contractor that the anticipated completion date should fall within the currently extended time for completion, the Contractor insisted on the date as shown on his programme. While the Architect is preparing his comments on the programme, the Employer would like to have a letter from you giving your view on:

(a) whether the Contractor is justified to show on the programme anticipated completion beyond the extended date;  

(b) what may be the reasons for the Contractor not complying with the Architect’s request;  

(c) why some contractors never update programmes; and  

(d) whether the Employer’s right will be diminished due to the above.

**Part B**

After the Architect’s written notification to the Contractor of his decision that no EOT should be granted against the claimed EOT and with reference to the Contractor’s submitted programme, the Architect verbally reminded the Contractor at site meeting No. 66 to expedite the progress of the Works in order to ensure that the Works are completed on time. It was recorded in the Minutes of Meeting promptly issued within 2 days as follows:

Progress of Works:  
	1.1 The Architect requested the Contractor to expedite the progress of the Works to complete before the currently extended time for completion.  
	1.2 The Architect requested the Contractor to re-sequence part of the Works so as to expedite.

One week later, the Contractor submitted a notice of claim for additional payment stating that:

“(a) An instruction has been given by the Architect as recorded under item 1.1 of the Minutes of Meeting No. 66 to accelerate the progress of works on Site, hence the Contractor is entitled to compensation for the costs of acceleration.  

“(b) Furthermore, an instruction has been given by the Architect as recorded under item 1.2 of the Minutes of Meeting. This constitutes a variation which should be measured and valued accordingly.”

You are requested to draft a letter to advise the Employer on the validity of the claim.

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A
	- Justification to show anticipated completion date beyond the extended date for completion
		- It is the responsibility of the Contractor to regularly update the master programme to reflect the current status of the progress of the works under SFBC cl.3.2(1)
		- A realistic programme should serve as a better tool to monitor progress and ascertain delays
		- Contractor has the sole right to plan the works as he likes
		- Provided that Contractor has reflected the true progress of the works with due consideration of possible means to complete the balance of the works regularly and diligently during the remaining contract period, the Architect cannot insist on the Contractor to submit a programme with anticipated completion date set earlier than the current completion date
		- The Contractor is therefore justified and in fact obliged to do so
	- Reasons for not comply with the Architect's request
		- If the delay is already beyond recovery, showing the extended date as the anticipated completion date would need to compress or advance many activities unrealistically. This may have the adverse effect of missing all the planned days for the unrealistic activities. The Contractor will then face serious complaints of slow progress.
		- Showing earlier completion may mean acceptance of the decision of no EOT
		- Showing earlier completion would need acceleration to achieve
		- If earlier completion is eventually achieved, it would be difficult to prove the existence of prior delay needing EOT
	- Reasons for not updating programmes
		- Some Contractors only update programmes when there is EOT but EOT is usually not readily granted. Keeping the original programme unchanged can put pressure upon all sub-contractors to work according to the original programme so as to catch up delays especially when the delays do not have or are unlikely to have EOT.
		- This can also put pressure upon the Architect to issue information or give comments and approval earlier so that the prospect of catching up culpable delays as well as claiming excusable delays due to Architect's late information, comments and approvals can be increased
	- Employer's right
		- The obligation of the Contractor under the Contract to carry out and complete the works on or before the current completion date will not be diminished or relieved no matter whether the Contractor updates the programme or not, with or without the Architect's comment (cl.2.2)
- B
	- Form of instruction
		- Instructions from Architect must be issued to Contractor in writing (cl.4.2(1))
		- Contractor may write to Architect to confirm the Architect's oral instruction within 7 days, but the oral instruction will be effective only if the Architect confirms it or not does not reject it within 7 days (cl.4.2(1))
		- Architect did request the Contractor to expedite and re-sequence but did not intend to result in additional payment. To avoid the Contractor's notice of claim from being treated as a confirmation of oral instruction, the Architect should clarify and reject the notice of claim within 7 days, though the Contractor's notice was submitted a week after the minutes and might have just missed the specified confirmation period.
	- Authority
		- Architect may issue instructions that he is empowered to issue under the Contract (cl.4.1). Strictly speaking, even if the Architect does not reject confirmation of oral instruction in time, oral instructions given beyond the Architect's authority will not be valid.
		- The Architect is empowered under the Contract to notify the Contractor if, in his opinion, the rate of progress of the works is too slow to ensure that the works will be completed by the current completion date for any reason which does not entitle the Contractor to EOT (cl.25.5(1)). In essence, there will be no payment to catch up the Contractor's own delay as requested by Architect
		- The Architect is empowered under the Contractor to request Contractor to propose delay recovery measures with additional payment to reduce delays which are entitled to EOT (cl.26.1). To be effective, the measures and additional payment must be specifically agreed by the Architect (cl.26.2(2)), and the Architect must issue an instruction to implement after receiving written directions from Employer (cl.26.3(1))
		- In any case, the Contractor's notice did not amount to an express mutual agreement
		- An instruction by the Architect for the Contractor to re-sequence the works may be regarded as a variation (cl.1.6) but the instruction may be subject to the formality described above to be effective
		- In order to avoid potential disputes, the Architect is recommended to clarify in writing his intention and intended implications of the oral instructions given in the site meeting.

## Question

Question No. 1 – Cost Estimate

You are the in-house quantity surveyor of property owner Hubbo. Hubbo is planning to refurbish its existing industrial building in Kowloon Bay to attract more affordable tenants. The whole building will be vacated before refurbishment.

The schematic design of G/F, 1/F and 2/F was reviewed this morning between Hubbo and the designer. The following two proposals i.e. P1 and P2 have been identified for further study:

P1. Add two pairs of escalators connecting G/F, 1/F and 2/F to attract F&B tenants and convert the areas around the escalators to public foyers on the three floors. Refer to Attachment A showing the proposed changes. The storey height is 6.5m for G/F and 5m for 1/F and 2/F. There is no basement.

Further upgrade to the building services main equipment or service mains is not required. Modern but not extravagant finishes are to be used. New building services installations are to be installed there. Refurbishment costs beyond the public foyers or on the façade can be excluded.

You are required to estimate the cost implication of this proposal. You may need to talk to the designer for further details. Record any backup discussions or assumptions.

[10 marks]

P2. Build a footbridge 15m long x 4m wide on 2/F across road to connect to an existing commercial development also owned by Hubbo and having a connectable lobby also on 2/F. You are required to prepare a query list of 10 items to clarify the choices of design and scope of work which may affect the costs very differently, and deserve attention for discussion with the Project Director and the designer. Cost estimate is not required at this moment. It would be premature to ask for structural member sizes.

[5 marks]

Please write an email to your Project Director furnishing your advice.

## Question

Question No. 2 – Cost Analysis

Developer Bumba recently won a land bid for a commercial site. Bumba is going to develop it into an office building – Project X. Bumba has just appointed your firm as the consultant QS.

Project X particulars:
- Site area = 2,000m2 
- No. Of storeys =40 (no basement) 
- Typical floor-to-floor height =4.2m
- Typical floor area =1,500m2

You are required to respond to the email below from Bumba’s Commercial Manager.

Dear QS,

The design team is studying two structural frame options: A) In-situ reinforced concrete frame; and B) Composite steel frame i.e. steel columns and beams with in-situ reinforced concrete core. Pre-stressing or post-tensioning is not considered at this moment.

1. Please estimate the structural cost difference between these two options. Please show your build-up of the elemental cost per m2 construction floor area (CFA) with assumptions in the absence of structural design information. The effects on the substructure and foundations can be excluded.

Project S is another project which is a reinforced concrete office building. Project S and Project X are very similar in terms of CFA, no. Of storeys, typical floor area and floor height.

Attachment S is the BQ extracted from the Main Contract of Project S for your estimation of structural option A. The BQ quantities have no error but the rates would need careful review.

[10 marks]

2. Apart from the structural frame, please advise on the very different impacts of using composite steel frame instead of reinforced concrete frame on the rest of the construction costs and procurement.

[5 marks]

Thanks.

CM Lee

- A - steel
	- Steel columns should either be enclosed with fire protection board or coated with fire protection material and enclosed with drywall or cladding. 
	- The structural ratios for the in-situ reinforced concrete option should be based on those of Project S. the structural ratios for concrete work for the composite steel structure option should preferably be by pro-rata from Project S otherwise the differences may not be easily justified.
	- The cost of composite steel frame is around 120% higher than the cost of the in-situ reinforced concrete frame.

	- ![image.png|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250805132101.png)
- B
	- Foundation - lighter because the overall building self-weight is lighter
	- Walls - more non-structural walls to replace the structural walls outside the core. More floor, wall and ceiling finishing areas created due to thinner walls. Junctions between non-structural walls and partitions with fireproof coated steel column and beams and with corrugated metal decking need special treatment
	- Columns - smaller columns. If concrete encased, slight increase in areas of floor finishes 
	- Metal decking - the interfacing details between corrugated metal decking and beams or columns and around edges must be carefully thought out before procurement to avoid variations
	- Hangers for architectural work and E&M works - hangers fixed  to steel beams or concrete slabs on steel decks would be by welding or special bolting. Hangers fixed to fireproof coated steel beams would also need fireproof coating
	- Openings - openings in steel members must be fixed before prefabrication of the steel members otherwise variation coats would be significant
	- Procurement - steel frame, metal decking and fireproofing would involve additional kinds of sub-contractors whether domestic or nominated. Due to the long lead time for design, statutory approval and material procurement, the long lead time for design, statutory approval and material procurement, the tendering for steel frames may need to be handled earlier than the commencement of the superstructure or even the foundations.
	- Design - the design of the steel frames must therefore be frozen very early for tendering and in any case before prefabrication. Subsequent design changes are usually costlier than changes to reinforced concrete structure
	- Programme - pure steel structure should be faster, but concrete core of composite steel structure and concrete casing to steel columns area on the critical path thus making it not must faster. 
	- Plant - special cranes must be used for the erection of the steel members. They may not be continued to be useful after the erection of the structure

#Procurement 
## Question

Question No. 4 – Contract Procurement

You are the consultant QS of a 2-storey warehouse development in Tai Po. The procurement approach is intended to be lump sum contract based on drawings and specification, with payment to the Contractor on a milestone basis. Tender documents have been prepared and are ready for tendering.

The Employer has set a tight time frame for completing the development. Furthermore, the budget for the development is tight and it is difficult for the Employer to raise additional finance if the budget is exceeded. Accordingly, the design consultants and you have already worked together to arrive at a completed and cost-effective design for the development.

In order to ensure the development be completed within the tight budget and on time, the Project Manager has just recommended the Employer to change the current contractual arrangement by adopting target cost contract with a predetermined pain/gain share arrangement.

The Project Manager believes that cost savings and early completion can be achieved if target cost contract is adopted, and accordingly the development can be completed within the tight budget and timeframe.

Having said that, the Employer is unsure whether the said benefits of using target cost contract is applicable to the warehouse development and would like you to advise on the following in the form of a letter:

(a) Additional requirements to be included under the current tender documents if target cost contract is adopted; and [5 marks]  

(b) Your recommendation on whether target cost contract should be adopted for this warehouse development. [5 marks]

[total 10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Additional requirement
	- Type of contract - target cost contract based on reimbursement of actual costs plus a fee
	- Target cost - a pre-determined target cost or mechanism for fixing the target cost based on the tenderer's estimate of the costs will be stated
	- The target cost plus Contractor's fee and the Employer's contingencies for permissible adjustments to the target cost should be less than maximum budget. The target cost itself should contain an allowance for changes not permissible to adjust the target cost
	- Adjustment of target cost - circumstances that the target cost will be adjusted will be specified. The normal definition of variations and events leading to loss and expense compensation under a lump sum contract will be reduced. Variations will usually be defined to mean a change of the scope of the works only, excluding any necessary changes to complete the works
	- Fees - the tenderers will be asked to quote their percentage fees or lump sum fees or  a combination of both, without or without benefit of a cost estimate. The percentage fee will be expressed as a mark-up on the actual costs, and may be calculated on a sliding scale. The fee can be specified to include lump sum preliminaries, lump sum attendance, percentage overheads and profit. A definition of what should be included in the preliminaries, attendance and overheads will be stated.
	- Pain / gain share - apartment from the fee, a pre-determined formula to calculate the pain / gain share of the difference between the final actual costs and the target cost will be stated. The pain / gain share may be of a sliding scale. A cost cap may also be set so that any cost overrun beyond the target cost by a certain percentage is not reimbursable to the Contractor
	- Contractor's cost saving proposal - any cost saving proposal by the Contractor will not be regarded as variations and will have no effect on the target price so as to encourage the Contractor to suggest cost saving proposals. The cost saving proposals must be agreeable by Employer
	- Payment - the Contractor will be reimbursed the actual costs supported by an open book cost accounting system
	- Definition of cost and fee - what can be and cannot be included in the actual cost to be reimbursed will be clearly stated. The definitions of cost and fee will be complementary with one of them to contain a catch-all statement that any cost not failing into one will be deemed to be included in the other
	- Cost estimate - the tenderers may be required to submit an estimate of the costs based on the drawings and specification. The estimated total cost plus fee and contingencies may become the target cost. The breakdown will serve post contract monitoring of the actual costs. The rates will be used to value cost adjustment to the target cost. It is possible that no cost estimate is expressly mentioned. In any case, the Contractor will be obliged to submit cost estimate and regular financial reports during the post contract stage
	- Subletting - a mechanism will be specified such that the Contractor's expenditure admissible to the actual costs will be subject to competitive tendering conducted by the Contractor where the selected suppliers and sub-contractors and the awarded prices must be approved by the Employer. A cost threshold invoking tendering may be specified. However, this may delay the programme
	- Partnering encouragement - partnering measures may be specified to encourage joint resolution of problems with a view to achieve the desired quality below the target cost and complete on time. Target cost contract requires a higher level of co-operation between the Employer and Contractor so as to drive the Contractor to innovate, save costs, work efficiently and solve problems as the project proceeds. Accordingly, measures to promote partnering should be stated in the contract, for example, partnering workshop, setting up a partnering charter, encouragement of joint discussions and resolution of problems, etc.
	- Lump sum price arrangement - it is also possible that the tenderers are required to give a lump sum based on the drawings and specification plus some contingencies to become a target price. Adjustment of the lump sum price will resemble the normal lump sum contract. The only differences will be that Contractor's cost saving proposal will be permitted and pain / gain share mechanism will be in place
- Recommendation or not 
	- Cost savings by adopting target cost contracts are mainly achieved by
		- Permitting Contractor to propose cost saving proposals
		- Relieving his risks and therefore his risk allowances over suppliers' and sub-contractors' prices which are not fixed at the time of the Contractor's tendering
	- Early completion by adopting target cost contracts is mainly achieved by getting the Contractor on board before completion of the design
	- For this project, it should be considered whether the above conditions exist
	- Despite the design for the development is completed for the Contractor to establish a realistic target cost, together with the inclusion of a cost cap so that any budget overrun will be wholly borne by the Contractor, the adoption of target cost contract is not recommended for the current development due to the following reasons:
		- Unlikely to have any significant cost savings
			- Design already completed - given the completeness of the design, there is little room for early contractor involvement to realize the potential cost cost savings by providing advice on buildability. Cost saving proposals may likely downgrade the existing design
			- Simple project nature - given the simplicity in nature of the development, it is unlikely that the Contractor can suggest significant cost saving proposals
			- Tight construction time frame - the already tight construction time frame renders early completion of the development difficult. Any savings related to site supervision cost are unlikely
			- Possibility of cost overrun - in view of the completeness of the design and its simplicity in nature, the possibility of cost overrun is little
		- Additional cost incurred by Employer, Consultants and Contractor
			- Employer's own cost - extra cost will be required for arranging trainings and partnering workshops to enhance the level of understanding and cooperation between Employer, consultants and Contractor
			- Additional consultancy fee - the consultants may request for additional fees, especially in providing more resources in checking the Contractor's open-book accounts against may invoices and receipts
			- Higher Contractor's administration cost - as the Contractor will have to account for the sub-letting process in a transparent manner to the Employer, will need to obtain more approvals, and will need to operate an open book accounting system, the administrative time spent will be more than that on the normal lump sum contracts where the Contractor can have autonomy to decide
			- Milestone payments - while it is still possible to use milestone payments, it will not be as straightforward as to be used on lump sum contract because there may not be confident lump sums readily available for the milestone payments
		- Delays to completion of the development
			- Tender document modification - additional time will be required to modify the existing tender documents which will further delay the overall completion of the development
			- Pre-qualification of contractor - an inexperienced or claim conscious contractor may jeopardize the target cost contracting process and not all contractors have experience in operating a target cost contract. A pre-qualification exercise may be required to shortlist contractors for tendering. This may defer the whole tendering process
		- Inherent risks of adopting target cost contract
			- Cost certainty - the main concern of the Employer is cost certainty. Target cost arrangement does not excel in offering cost certainty to the Employer
			- Target setting - incorrect target setting can drive a focus on raising the target through claims rather than suggesting innovative savings
			- Risk sharing mechanism - it is not easy to derive a correct incentive mechanism (the pain / gain formula) so as to drive the right behavior of the Contractor
			- Limited contract forms - there is limited number of standard forms of contract using target cost. Ad-hoc drafting of contract clauses may lead to misunderstanding of liabilities between the parties
			- Well suited to long term relationships - use of target cost favours the establishment of long term relationship but not for one-off project

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 1 – Valuation of Variations

You are the consultant QS of a sports centre project. The Employer has awarded the piling and superstructure works under a single contract where the Works (except the foundation works) are to be designed by the Architect while the foundation works are to be designed by the Contractor. The Contract included a set of Bills of Quantities for the superstructure part while the Contractor was required to submit a lump sum price with quantity and rate breakdown for the foundation works in the tender (refer to Attachment A for part of the breakdown).

At the tender stage, apart from the provision of a loading schedule for the piles to support, the Project Structural Engineer has prepared a design for the piling and incorporated the same as part of the Tender Booklet for tenderers' reference. The piling design was marked “for reference only”, which comprised 200 No. 305 x 305 ×180 kg/m driven steel H piles with an average length of 35m.

One week after the Commencement of the Works, the Project Structural Engineer issued a Site Instruction No. SE-002 to revise the loading schedule. The Contractor, based on the revised loading schedule, prepared and submitted a revised piling schedule.

At the following site meeting, the Contractor reported that the revised piling schedule came up with 190 No. 305×305×180kg/m driven steel H piles with an average length of 35m, and submitted a quotation for a net addition of $700,000 to the Contract Sum (refer also to Attachment A).

The Project Structural Engineer subsequently carried out a check and agreed to the Contractor's submitted revised design but has query about the cost implication of the variation. In his opinion, the variation should result in a cost reduction for 10 No. Of piles, when compared with the original design.

The Project Manager asks for your opinion on the above. You are required to provide a contractual analysis and advise on the proper fact finding approach to deal with the issue. The Project Manager is a meticulous person and would not be satisfied with a simple broad-brush answer.

## Assessor Notes

- Contractual analysis
	- Binding contract 
		- The tender documents were prepared based Architect's design with BQ, but the foundation works were required to be included in the tender based on Contractor's design. The quantities estimated by the Contractor based on his design and indicated in the lump sum price breakdown for the foundation works shall not form part of the Contract.
		- The piling design prepared by SE thought issued to the Contractor for tendering was marked to be for reference only and therefore does not form part of the Contract.
		- The mere fact that the Contractor's quantities in the price breakdown match nicely with the reference design prepared by SE does not necessarily follow that the quantities or the reference design shall form part of the Contract
	- VO basis
		- For the same contract sum, the Contractor shall be and shall only be responsible for providing a piling design sufficient to support the building in compliance with the original contract requirements. Any up or down errors made in the preliminary design or in the estimated quantities or rates shall not result in any adjustment to the contract sum or completion time
		- Instead of comparing against the quantities stated in the price breakdown, the variation shall be valued by comparing the piling design that has or would have been prepared by the Contractor fulfilling the original contract requirements, i.e. the baseline piling design based on the original loading schedule, against the revised piling design based on the revised loading schedule under site instruction
		- The consequential changes to the rest of the foundations designed by the Contractor should also be considered
- Suggested approach
	- In order to compare between the original and the revised piling designs, it is necessary to identify the baseline design which is the one fulfilling the original contract requirements
		- As part of the supporting information for his submitted quotation, the Contractor should be requested to provide the baseline design as the basis of the omission cost in variation
		- A preliminary design may have been submitted by Contractor at the tender stage but this usually would be regarded as for reference only. However, it is advisable to check the Contract or, if the formal Contract Documents have not been prepared yet, the correspondence exchanges during the tender stage to see whether the Contractor has submitted any piling design which has been agreed upon to form part of contract as the baseline design. In the absence of an accepted baseline design before the award of the contract, the baseline design must be the one submitted by the contract after the award of contract and accepted by the SE as fulfilling the original contract requirements 
		- If non baseline design has been submitted or if the previous design submitted by the contractor did not fulfill the original contract requirements, the contractor should be required to submit or re-submit the baseline design for acceptance by SE as fulfilling the original contract requirements
	- SE's acceptance of baseline design
		- Even though the acceptable design may result in fewer or lighter piles than those stated in the lump sum price breakdown, SE cannot insist on adding more piles. The baseline design so accepted shall be used for the valuation of the variation as described earlier
	- Impact on other elements
		- SE should also be reminded to check the implication on the pile caps and tie beams design so as to ensure that there is no undue saving in piling costs at the expense of pile caps and tie beams costs. The cost effects on the pile caps and tie beams should also be considered as part of the variation. The principle as described for the piles in respect of comparing between the designs before and after the loading schedule revision should also apply to the pile caps and tie beams.
	- If Contractor refused to submit any baseline design
		- Advice from SE should be sought regarding a notional baseline piling design for the purpose of valuation of variation

## Question

Question No. 2 – Disruption Claims

You are the consultant QS of a commercial redevelopment project. Your Client’s Project Manager, Mr. Chan has just received a claim for extension of time of 15 days and monetary compensation amounting to HK $500,000 for a series of disruptions to the regular progress of the Contractor’s works. Mr. Chan considers the claim unreasonable and superfluous and has written to you for your advice. Mr. Chan’s email is given below: -

---

Hi,

I refer to the Contractor’s claim submitted last week claiming extension of time of 15 days and an extravagant amount of HK $500,000. Having studied the Contractor’s submission, I am of the view that the claim is unjustifiable under the Contract and shall be struck out at once for the following reasons: -

1. Although there is no dispute that the disruptions were caused by the late release of information by the Architect, most of such disruptions indeed ran parallel with the Contractor’s own delay. The Contractor would still have been in delay had there been no late release of information causing the said disruptions. As such, no extension of time shall be granted. [5 marks]

2. By the same token, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any monetary compensation for disruptions which run concurrently with the Contractor’s own delay. [5 marks]

3. Although the Contractor has served an extension of time and loss & expense claim in accordance with the Contract, the particulars submitted by the Contractor, though appearing to be comprehensive in terms of volume, are not satisfactory as they do not cover the FULL details of each of the particulars of the claim. [5 marks]

Could you please look into this and give me your advice for my further discussion with our Finance Director?

---

In your reply to Mr. Chan, you should analyze the contractual position with reference to the relevant clauses of the Contract and advise whether there are sufficient grounds to strike out the Contractor’s claim.

## Assessor Notes

- EOT for overlapping delays
	- Concurrent delay has very special and strict meaning as decided by court cases, but there is no need to dwell into the detail for the purpose of this question. Overlapping delays is used here to avoid going into that complication
	- Employer's delay here means a delay entitling Contractor to EOT 
	- Contractor's delay here means a delay not entitling Contractor to EOT
	- Subject to the contract provisions, the general principle of law is that Employer is obliged to afford the agreed time to Contractor to carry out the works. If during the course of the works, the remaining time afforded for carrying out the balance of the works is reduced due to an Employer's delay, the Employer shall compensate the time so reduced by granting an EOT of equal magnitude. Whether the remaining time is already not achievable due to Contractor's delays is immaterial. The foregoing is an example of the application of the principle that the Employer shall not prevent Contractor from carrying out the works, and the Employer shall not benefit from his own prevention.
	- If the work affected by the late provision of information lies on the critical path to the completion of the works, the late provision will reduce the remaining time afforded for carrying out the balance of the works and should entitle the Contractor to EOT
	- Bonus: recent case in UK decided that if it is expressly agreed in the Contract beyond doubt that the Contractor will not be entitled to EOT due to Employer's delay overlapping Contractor's delay, the contract agreement will be upheld. The standard forms of contract to be used for these Practice Problems do not contain such provisions
	- SFBC provision
		- Employer's delay is called listed event
		- Late provision of information is a listed event pursuant to clause 25.1(3)(1) and 25.3(1) subject to other provisions on notice requirements
		- There is no provision in the Conditions of Contract inconsistent with the general principle stated above. In face, clause 25.3(6) dealing with delays after the extended Completion Date gives support that EOT should still be granted for Employer's delay occurring during a period of Contractor's delay
- Monetary claims for overlapping delays
	- For the purpose of this question, compensable event is used to mean a delaying event for which the Contractor is entitled to loss and expense compensation under the Contract
	- There is a school of thought that if a compensable event occurs during the period of Contractor's delay, since the Contractor would have incurred the loss and expense anyway, the compensable delay would not cause additional loss and expense to the Contractor and the Employer would not need to compensate the loss and expense.
	- The period of Contractor's delay occurring before compensable event is not caused by the Employer and should therefore not be the Employer's concern. However, when the compensable event starts to occur, there can be rooms for counter-arguments to the above school of thought.
	- An argument would be that if a view is taken prospectively at the time of the start of the compensable event, EOT would need to be granted for the compensable event, which invariably is also an Employer's delay. The period of extension would cause loss and expense to the Contractor and the Contractor should be compensated. During the period until the end of the extended period, the Contractor is free to work at his own pace. Any slow progress during this period should not affect the compensation. 
	- Another argument is that after the start of the compensable event, its impact is more dominant than that of the Contractor's delay, e.g. lasting for a longer time. Loss and expense should be compensated for the dominant delay.
	- SFBC provision
		- Compensable event is called qualifying event
		- Late provision of information is a qualifying event pursuant to cl.27.1(2)(g) subject to other provisions on notice requirements
		- It may be noted, however, that clause 27.3 requires that when a qualifying event is partly contributed to or aggravated by Contractor's default
- Sufficiency of Contractor's particulars of claim
	- For EOT, cl.25.2 requires the Contractor to submit full particulars with his second notice of EOT claim, and the Architect is obliged to consider EOT entitlement after receipt of the second notice. However, there is no provision stating that the submission of the full particular must be a condition precedent to considering EOT. In fact, clause 25.3(4), (7), (8) permit the Architect to take the initiative to review previous EOT to the extent that he is able to do so based on information available or so far as fair and reasonable.
	- For L&E, according to clause 28.3, submission of full particulars is a condition precedent to entitlement. However, it would appear that if some particulars are sufficient to justify part of a claim, it would be unreasonable not to consider that part of the claim to the extent justifiable.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Site Possession

A building development comprises one Foundation Contract and one Superstructure Contract. The works of the Foundation Contract are in progress whereas the Superstructure Contract has been awarded two weeks ago and the possession date of the Site has been confirmed to be one month from the date of the award of the Superstructure Contract (i.e. two weeks from now) according to the Employer’s letter of acceptance.

In the Superstructure Contract, the Particular Specification contains the following Clause 1.20 and Clause 1.21:

- “Clause 1.20 - The possession date of the Site as stated elsewhere in the Contract is for indication only. No monetary claim in connection therewith will be entertained.”
- “Clause 1.21 - Notwithstanding any provisions provided to the contrary, the Architect shall have the right to issue an instruction for the addition of foundation works to the Contract. The Contractor shall comply with such instruction and complete the Works to the satisfaction of the Architect. No monetary claim in connection therewith will be entertained.”

Now two weeks later after the award of the Superstructure Contract, the Structural Engineer just reported today that the foundation works were in serious trouble. A number of critical footings without piles had been found to have been constructed incorrectly and would require complete removal. It is expected that, with due diligence, the foundation works can only be completed in 6 weeks, i.e. about 4 weeks later than the one month anticipated in the letter of acceptance. Another big trouble is that the Foundation Contractor has already been in financial difficulties. He may not be able to bear the costs of rectification of the footings and may slow down or go bankrupt.

You are not related to the project at all. The Employer has just called you after hearing the report by the Structural Engineer, and requested you to act as a devil’s advocate to critically see whether Particular Specification Clause 1.20 and Clause 1.21 are able to protect him from monetary claims that may be submitted by the Superstructure Contractor when either of the following situations occurs:

(i) The Foundation Contractor still survives with financial support by the Employer and the remaining foundation works can be completed in 6 weeks from now for handover to the Superstructure Contractor.  

(ii) The Foundation Contractor becomes bankrupt and the Superstructure Contractor is then instructed to finish the remaining foundation works under the Superstructure Contract.

Please provide your advice in a letter and explain your reasons with reference to relevant contract provisions.

## Assessor Notes

- Spec clause waive claim for postponement v LOA
	- Bonus: Spec clause is imprecise. A date "as stated elsewhere in the Contract" can mean a date as stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents which will become part of the Contract or a date as to be stated elsewhere in the Contract eventually constituted
	- Normally, this kind of clause would say that the possession date of the site as stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents is for indication only. The date will be subject to confirmation upon the award of the Contract or by means of an Architect's Instruction after the award of the Contract. No monetary claim will be entertained if the confirmed date is not later than a certain date. This would give a limited period for the Contractor to take the risk of a non-definite possession date.
	- The possession date of the site has been confirmed in the Employer's LOA with no similar stipulation that this is still indicative. LOA is the concluding document conforming the offer and acceptance process and shall take precedence over the Particular Specification. The no claim intention should apply if the actual possession date is within the one month as confirmed in the LOA, but would not apply to the period beyond.
	- Employer may argue that Spec clause is wide enough to refer to the date as stated in LOA as indicative only subject to further adjustment. This argument would appear to be weak
	- Contractor may argue that Spec clause is of no effect at all as it intends to override the Conditions of Contract which permit L&E compensation for delayed possession date but CC should take precedence. The chance of success would depend on express term of CC used. It is common practice to state in Tender Documents some modification to the standard terms of CC. In the absence of express terms in the Contract to deny the effect, the modification stated in Spec is explicit and cannot be totally ignored. The no claim period stated in Spec should be valid, when being read in conjunction with the confirmed date as stated in LOA
	- Contractor may also argue that there is no definite period for him to take the risk. In the absence of a definite period, the tender validity period may serve as a useful limit. The Contract is supposed to be awarded within the tender validity period for immediate commencement after on or two weeks' notice. The no claim period can reasonably be interpreted as no later than the end of such notice period but not beyond. It is considered that this is the best approach to operate Spec clause.
	- The final defense available to the Contractor would be to see whether the Contract contains provision for him to determine his employment or terminate the Contract if the delay to site possession is exceeding a certain permissible maximum period
	- SFBC provision
		- Cl.5.1 means that CC take precedence over Spec, but LOA takes precedence over CC unless modified later in Appendix upon formal signing of Contract
		- In this circumstance, the one month stated in LOA is the period of waiver of monetary claim
		- Bonus: cl.36.1 authorizes Contractor to service notice of default leading to determination of employment if the possession date is delayed by more than 120 days
- Spec clause waive claim for addition of works
	- It is unimaginable that the Contractor would really agree to carry out additional foundation works with no monetary claim at all. The only reasonable interpretation having business sense is that the additional work will be measured and valued as a normal variation. EOT for the additional work will be granted. Only the monetary claim over the above the normal valuation of variation, i.e. loss and expense claims in connection with disruptions and prolongation, are to be considered here.
	- Contractor may argue that the foundation works are of special nature not belonging to his usual nature of work or the foundation works are outside the scope of the Superstructure Contract, and therefore, he is not obliged to take up the additional foundation works simply by way of an AI. However, it is normal for Spec to described the scope of the works and optional works. The additional foundation works have been specified as possible optional works, there is no reason to deny the validity of spec clause in this manner.
	- As the possession date was supposed to be available one month after the award of Superstructure Contract, this should serve as a good indication to the Contractor at the time of entering into the Superstructure Contract regarding the time required to complete the additional foundation works if so instructed, and hence the period of prolongation in respect of which the waiver of monetary claim should apply.
	- Contractor may argue that he had no reason to believe and contemplate that there would not be some progress by FDN after LOA. Therefore, the period of waiver of monetary claim should be much less than one month. 
	- The conclusion of the above is that the maximum period of waiver that the Employer can argue for is one month after the date of LOA and a reasonable settlement would be a shorter period to be negotiated. The breaking up and removing of the incorrect footings should not be included in the waiver.
	- SFBC provision
		- Clause 13.1(1)(c) authorizes Contractor to refuse to comply with instructions which would fundamentally change the scope or nature of the works. However, as explained above, the additional foundation works should not fall into this kind of work
- Differences between two situations (i) and (ii)
	- As far as the monetary waivers are concerned, the two situations (i) and (ii) are both subject to the same arguments mentioned above. A possible difference would be that the bankruptcy under situation (ii) may happen any time within or beyond the 6 weeks' periods estimated for situation (i). Stoppage of work due to bankruptcy will require extra time to the conduct survey, to check and record the work done, to take over the incomplete work, to retrieve past inspection records and test certificates, and to rectify any defects found, not to mention the possible need to put the works out for competitive tendering.

## Question

Question No. 4 – Nominated Sub-Contract

You are the consultant QS of a residential development project.

6 weeks after the award of the Main Contract to Smart Build Construction Co. Ltd. (“Smart Build”), the Architect issued an instruction to Smart Build which requires Smart Build to enter into a Nominated Sub-Contract with Bravo Engineering Co. Ltd. (“Bravo”) for the Supply and Installation of MVAC Works.

Within 3 days from the receipt of the Architect’s instruction, Smart Build wrote to the Architect rejecting the nomination of Bravo as the MVAC Nominated SubContractor on the following grounds: -

1. As shown in Bravo’s submitted programme, the delivery of the chiller at Basement Level 1 is two months later than the scheduled date as per Smart Build’s master programme which has been approved by the Architect last week. The late delivery of the chiller will affect the completion of the ground slab which falls on the critical path on the approved master programme.

2. Smart Build noted that the Prime Cost Sum for MVAC provided in the Bills of Quantities is HK $50 million only while Bravo's tender sum is HK$45 million only. Bravo’s financial capability of completing the MVAC works is therefore questionable. Furthermore, Smart Build considers that he has suffered a loss of profit due to the difference between the Prime Cost Sum and the awarded Sub-Contract Sum.

3. In one piece of the tender correspondence exchanged between the Employer and Bravo, Bravo qualified that the liquidated damages for the delayed completion of the MVAC Nominated Sub-Contract shall be HK $50,000 per day. However, the liquidated damages stipulated in the Main Contract for delayed completion is HK$100,000 per day. Smart Build does not accept such a qualification.

The Architect has just called you to request you to send him an email advising the relevant contract provisions by noon tomorrow.

You know that: -

1. In the Letter of Nomination issued by the Employer to Bravo, no method statement and programme submitted during the tendering period shall form  part of the MVAC Sub-Contract.
2. As stated in the Appendix to the MVAC Nominated Sub-Contract Conditions, the Sub-Contract Works are to be carried out at the same time as the Main Contract Works with no separate completion date.
3. There is no qualification, other than that on liquidated damages, spotted in Bravo’s tender.

## Assessor Notes

- General
	- Under SFBC, Contractor has the right to raise objection to AI requiring him to enter into NSC contract (cl.29.1(1), (3))
	- MC has made his objection to the nomination within the time required under cl.29.2(3). It is for Architect to decide whether the objection is valid (cl.29.2(5))
	- If the Architect considers the objection to be vaid, the Architect may withdraw the nomination instructino per cl.29.2(5)(a). Alternatively, Architect may invoke cl.29.2(5)(b) and refuse to withdraw the nomination instruction despite the valid objection with the caveat that Contractor will have the right to EOT cl.25.1(3)(n) and L&E udner cl.27.1(2)(h) to the extent that the delay or disruption was atrributable to the grounds for objection raised by Contractor to nomination.
- Late delivery of chiller
	- Under SFBC cl.29.1(1)(d), MC can raise objection if programme is unreasonable. Althought LON provides that no programme submitted by NSC during tender period should form part of the sub-contract, it cannot simply be assumed that NSC can revise it significantly to suit MC's master programme. Architect should be advised to take a reviwe of NSC's submission and convene a meeting with MC and NSC to resolve the apparent conflict. It may be possible that the delivery date as shown on MC master programme was not one of the essential or critical itme scrutinized by Architect when he approved the master programme, and that there can still be some float time for chiller delivery. MC cannot unreasonably refuse adjustment to suit.
	- If the conflict cannot be resolved, MC's objection should be considered valid. Should Architect insist upon the nomination notwithstanding the valid objection, MC is still obliged to enter into NSC under cl.29.2(6). In such circumstances, MC is entitled under Contractor to EOT and L&E.
- NSC award sum lower than PC sum
	- Under SFBC, MC can raise objection if NSC's tender sum if not financially viable (cl.29.2(1)(c)) or if NSC's is not financially capable (cl.29.2(1)(c)).
	- The mere fact that NSC's tender sum (HK $45M) is 10% lower than the corresponding PC sum (HK$50M) cannot be a sufficient justification that the tender sum is not financially viable because the different can be caused by many reasons, e.g. an over estimate of PC sum, a change in scope or design ater the inclusion of PC sum in MC, or a very competitive market, etc.  A 10% deviation cannot be considered as abnormal.
	- Event if the tender sum is low, it is not an indication that NSC is not or will not be financially capable to support it, nor an infication that NSC is currently financially incapable.
	- NSC's tender prices and financial standing have been scrutinized during tender stage to be in reasonable order. MC's objection should therefore not be accepted as valid, unless NSC can provide better evidence to prove his case. To be prident, MC's story should be heard to ensure that there is no insider information to be missed.
	- Depending on the final outcome, the nomination should either be withdrawn or insisted upon in the same manner as mentioned above.
	- Reduced profit due to the difference between the awarded NSC sum and PC sum shall not be considered as a valid ground for objection to nomination.
	- If this if put forwarded as a claim for loss of profit, it is not admissible for various reasons:
		- There has been no guarantee that the awarded NSC sum must be very close to PC sum. 
		- Usually state in Contract that no monetary claim for adjustment of PC sum
		- PC sum serve as a budgetary allowances and are usually set higher
		- A 10% difference is not abnormal
		- The final NSC sum may become higher to narrow down the difference
		- Some other NSC sum may be higher than PC sum to offset this particular difference
- Disparity of LAD due to NSC's qualification
	- It should be recalled and checked whether NSC's tender qualification regarding LAD has been accepted. There must have been som good reasons to have accepted NSC's qualification. 
	- Under SFBC NSC, the liability for delay damages are written in such a way that the NSC is liable to reimburse MC any loss and expense incurred by MC and any LAD imposed by Employer upon MC ude to the failure of NSC to complete on time under cl.24.1 & 24.2.
	- If the LAD payable by NSC is not sufficient to cover MC's rate of LAD caused by NSC's delay, MC will suffer. The terms of sub-contract to be nominated must be consistent with those made known to MC during his tendering. If such disparity is not made known to him during his tendering, MC's objection is valid. Unless the nomination is withdrawm or NSC agrees to withdraw the qaulification now, the disparity should be regarded as a vaiation (cl.29.5(2)). Employer will have to bear the shortfall in recovery caused by the disparity.

## Question

Question No. 1 – Cost Comparison

You are the newly recruited Assistant QS Manager of Good Investment Ltd. Good is going to develop a new-build 5-star hotel “Project T”. Good’s Project Manager wrote you an email below. Please reply to the Project Manager by an email.

---

Dear AQS Manager,

I know that you have reviewed the Scheme Design Cost Plan for Project T prepared by our Consultant QS and you consider it in order. However, I have found that the unit construction cost in $/m2 GFA is approximately 15% higher than that of our first hotel “Project W” completed a few years ago. Given the time, I can only recall some key information about Project W below for comparison. I understand you may need more information about Project W for a detailed comparison, but, for the time being, please advise on the probable reasons for the difference based only on the information available.

## Assessor Notes

- Grade
	- Project T is a 5-star hotel. The grade of Project W is not given in the question. If Project W is of a lower grade, it would be cheaper.
- Contract Sum
	- It is not sure whether the Contract Sum of Project W is the Final Contract Sum. Project T's estimate is supposed to forecast the Final Contract Sum inclusive allowance for contingencies (though at 2019Q1 price leevel, meaning that further fluctuations are excluded). Project W should also use the Final Contract Sum.
- Point in time for TPI adjustment
	- It is not sure how TPI was used for adjustment. TPI taken at the time of estimate, the time of contract award, the middle of the construction period or the end of the construction period can be different by a few percentage. Any inconsistency in the points may contribute to the difference. 
- Index trend
	- The index trend at the times of the two projects should be studies. If the TPI at the time of Project W was dropping, while that of Project T is rising, the difference will be bigger.
- Suitability of TPI
	- The completion date of Project W was July 2014. The contract award date should be at least 2 or 3 years ealier. The suitability of using TPI more than 7-8 years ago is doubtful.
- Scope of works
	- The scope of works covered by contract sum of Project W is not known. An apple-to-apple comparison is required for the two projects. The extent of FF&E included in the construction contract may vary between projects.
- Proportions of functional areas
	- The proportions of functional areas are quite different. Project T has bigger proportion of the more expensive FOH.

- Room size
	- The average room area is 80m2 for Project W and 65m2 for Project T. If the provisions within a room are the same, smaller rooms will cost more per unit area because the costs of interal walls, wall finishes, doors, windows, furniture and fittings are not sensitive to the reduction of floor area per room.
- Technological change
	- TPI shows a general historical trend of tender prices of the construction industry. It is usually complied based on the same set of work and quantities priced at rates at different times. The rates may reflect the changes to the quality of work over years and statutory or market influences on the price levels, but would not reflect those technological changes or statutory requirements causing different or more varieties and quantities of work per the same CFA, e.g. fundamental change of the construction methods shifting the distribution of the type of work per CFA, changes in the extent of exempted GFA resulting in different extent of work per CFA, provision of green building features. Generally, the standard of work and quantities per CFA have increase over the years.
- Design standard
	- Although the same designer is appointed for both projects, it does not mean the design standards are the same for both projects. Different designs will cost very differently
- Location
	- Repulse Bay is considered relatively remote as compared to Tsuen Wan with respect to travelling time of workers, proximity to factories in the mainland, cargo ship and airport terminals, delivery of materials and plant. Environmental nuisance control would be more stringent. The location factor may contribute to some cost different.
- Site condition
	- While the site conditions are not known, it is permissible to doubt whether Repulse Bay's site is more likely to be on slope or im rocky groudn while Tsuen Wan site is more likely to be in reclaimed ground
- Other factors
	- Other factors such as floor-to-floor heihgt, facade ratio, number storeys, number of lift stops, programme, contract terms, etc are unlikely to cause significant contribution to the higher unit rate. If the Candidates attempt to put forward these or other factors, they should demonstrate that the factors are very likely even though there is no information of the time being

## Question

Question No. 2 – Modular Integrated Construction

You are the Consultant QS for the construction of the superstructure of five 28- storey residential blocks on a site in Kowloon Bay. The number of residential flats is 8 per storey. The Employer would like to change the flats from in-situ reinforced concrete construction to Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), where the structure, finishes, building services and equipment of the modules are manufactured and assembled in the factories before transportation to the site for installation. He wishes to enhance quality control, site safety, environmental performance (construction waste, noise and air nuisance reduction), and productivity, in a shorter construction time.

The Architect asks you apart from the perceived benefits what problems and issues should be considered before adopting MiC. Please reply by an email. Give 18 points preferably grouped under different aspects for easy understanding.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Contract Drafting

You are the Consultant QS for a proposed new school project now in the early stage of tender documentation for the foundations and superstructure works. Demolition works are being done on site. The Client has expressed his concern about the timely completion of the project in order to suit the programme for school opening. At a project meeting, the Project Manager has suggested the following possible ways to secure the timely completion of the project:

(a) Change the foundation works from Engineer’s design to Contractor’s design;  
(b) Shorten the period for notifying delays by the Contractor to eliminate those delays; and  
(c) Add requirements for notifying delays as conditions precedent to granting extension of time.

Please reply by an email advising on the contractual feasibility, possible benefits, possible problems and issues, and effectiveness to achieve the goal. [9 marks]

Suggest concisely 6 other suggestions to achieve the goal. [3 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Engineer's design changed to Contractor's design
	- Contractual feasibility
		- It is contractually feasible to procure the foundation works as a design and build item as far as the scope of the works and design liability are clearly stated in the Contract
	- Possible benefits
		- The responsibility for design and obtaining Government approval and consent will usually passed on to the Contractor
		- The risks of gound conditions may also be passed on to the Contractor
		- While more risks are passed on to the Contractor, the valid chances for the Contracgtor to claim EOT will be reduced
		- The tenderer may be able to propose a better solution to suit his plant resources, and design and build expertise, with time and cost benefits
		- Contractor may have greater incentive to optimize the design to suit his resources, with time and cost benefits
	- Possible problems and issues
		- Any ambiguity in Contract or any change of the scope of work and design liability for D&B item will still become a variation which will have EOT entitlement as well
		- The foundation loading schedule will usually be given to Contractor during tendering to form his basis for tendering. A change of the loading schedule will be variation
		- Contractor can only start his design after the award of Contract, while Engineer's design can start earlier and gain time for Government approval and consent.
		- Including Engineer's foudation works design in the Tender Documents for tenderers' reference only and taking up the risks is one usual solution
		- Moving forward the tendering time to secure Contractor's foundation works design may mean earlier freeze of the superstructure design and lesser time for the development of the deatils for the rest of project
		- Whether there will be time advantage as compared to Engineer's design would depend on the time left from now until the respective times for obtaining Government consent
		- The time spent by Architect is approving Contractor's design may become too long and result in EOT entitement
		- Contractor's programme may have no or little buffer for disapproval by Government
		- Contractor may not have expertise in foundation works and will have to sublet to others. The expected design and cost benefits may be reduced.
		- More intensive post contract supervision and monitoring may be required as there may be higher tendency for Contractor to design down to cut cost
	- Time goal
		- The suggestion can reduce the Contractor's EOT entitlement but is unlikely to reduce Contractor's actual possibility of delays
- Shorten the delay notice
	- Contractual feasibility
		- It is contractually feasible to shortent the contractual period for notifying delays so long as the contract provisions have clearly so state
	- Possible benefits
		- It may help an early warning to the Architect and Employer for them to implement measure to mitigation delay before it is too late
	- Possible problems and issues
		- Without express words to the effect of imposing a time bar, any time frames specified can only be regarded as a matter of good practice. Any failure to comply may not have serious implication to the effect of reducing EOT entitlement
		- Also, the time to start counting the period may not be concisely determinable, e.g. the usual phrase "the commencement of an event likely to cause delay" for the purpose of starting to count the period is not a precise term and may cause different interpretations and arguments
		- The shortened notifying period may cause Contractor to submit enormous number of NOD with insufficient details to cover every even which may cause possible or potential delay to safeguard his position. More time resources will be spent by Architect and Contractor to deal with these notices leaving less time to deal with more important matters.
		- Architect may not be able to respond to the enormous number NOD reasonably promptly and this may result in a time-at-large argument
	- Time goal
		- The suggestion will not reduce the Contractor's EOT entitlement nor Contractor's actual possibility of delays
- Add condition precedent requirements
	- Contractual feasibility
		- It is contractually feasible to add more stringent requirements on notifying delays and submitting detailed claim particulars as conditions precedent to granting EOT
	- Possible benefits
		- By making it more difficult to claim, EOT entitlement may be reduced
	- Possible problems and issues
		- Conditions precedent may deal with the period for notifying delays and submitting detailed claim usually in the form of a time bar, and with the particulars to be submitted usually in terms of sufficiency
		- A time bar in respect of neutral event will be more readily upheld than a time bar in respect of acts of delays or preventions by Employer, the Architect or persons fro whom they are reasonable. For the time bars to be effective, the intent must be expressly stated beyond doubt
		- As mentioned above, the start time to count the permissible time can be difficult to ascertain
		- For the sufficiency of particulars to be submitted, it is always open to argument as to whether the particular are sufficient
		- The administrative burden as mentioned above also apply here
		- Very stringent EOT provision may limit Architect's or the PM's flexibility to exercise discretion to resolve disputes. The dispute may end up in the more costly dispute resolution methods
		- More strignet requirements may attract higher prices or reduce tendering interest
		- If the specified contract period is estimated to be shorter than the realistic contract period, allowance for LAD will likely by included in the tender sums. This means the contract period is not really realistic.
	- Time goal
		- The suggestion can reduce Contractor's EOT entitlement but is unlikely to reduce Contractor's actual possibility of delays
- Suggestion to shorten overall project time
	- Design
		- Reduce possible variaitons by incorporating as full a possible the Employer's wishes in the Tender Documents
		- Reduce possible variations by reviewing the adequacy and consistency of the drawings and specification
		- Submit to Gov dept for approval as early as possible during design stage
		- Shorten the design period by deferring the detailed design of non-critical and non-signficant items to the post contract stage, if the potential extra costs so incurred can be afforded
	- Procurement
		- Call for the foundation works tender first without waiting for the detailed design of superstructure works to complete
		- Exclude work not essential for school opening
		- Make work not essential for school opening as optional items which may be omitted with no claim for profit if there is no enough time left do the work, and with stipulation that the omission can be taken into account in EOT assessment
	- Time
		- Shorten the contract period to give buffer for unavoidable delays with or without extension of time entitlement
		- Delete ground for EOT for inclement weather
		- Act proactively and promptly to resolve post contract problems
		- Give incentive for early completion

## Question

Question No. 4 – Stage Payment / Activity Schedule

You are the in-house Quantity Surveyor of a Developer and are responsible for the procurement of a proposed 10-storey carpark in Shum Shui Po (“the Project”).

The tender drawings and specification for the Project have been completed. In the absence of external Consultant QS, your company accepts to invite tenders based on drawings and specification without bills of quantities.

Your Project Manager would like to use stage payment method to simplify the payment process, and has also heard about the use of activity schedule in lieu of bills of quantities in some modern forms of contract.

Your Project Manager would like you to advise him via a memo:

(a) The features, mechanism and advantages of stage payment method, and the possible drawbacks and preventive actions; and  [7 marks]  

(b) The special differences between using activity schedule and using stage payment method. [5 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Stage payment
	- Mechanism
		- A stage payment schedule is included in Tender Documents whereby thw works are broken down into various stages for the purposes of payment and the amount against each stage will be paid only upon the completion of the stage. The schedule may also be agreed ad-hoc after the return of tenders.
		- Usually, payment will be made based on the stags completed by regular payment valuation dates. If there are only a few stages, payments may be paid as and when a stage is completed independent of any regular payment valuation dates.
		- The most stringent arrangement is to link the stage payment to a milestone date whereby the stage payment will be made only if the milestone date is met but this will increase the Contractor's financial burden and will trigger claims for adjustment of the milestone date.
	- Basis of the amounts payable
		- Tenders are invited with BQ provided to the tenderers or SOR submitted by tenderers. The use of a stage payment schedule would not affect the tender documentation time or tendering time.
		- The amount payable against each stage will be a pre-fixed percentage of Contract Sum or a sum linked to the priced BQ or SOR or a lump sum with no link at all.
	- Relevance to programme
		- The stages may not be closely related to the programme activities of Contractor
	- Cash flow expectation
		- The cash flow requirements and expectation for both parties are more definite
	- Motivation
		- In order to receive payment, Contractor is motivated to complete each stage to the fullset extent
	- Ease of implementation
		- If the stage payments are specified in the form of fixed percentages and fixed lump sums, the valuation for payment based on the achievement of the specified criteria will be very easy
		- If the stage payments are links to priced BQ or SOR, then the more time-consuming valuation based on quantities of work done and MOS is still required with no time saving
		- If the description of a stage is worded to be too restrictive or subjective, this may render no payment if there are minor incompleteness or minor defects or stringent acceptance attitude. The descriptions should be written very carefully with room for approximation and tolerances. Criteria based on some objective benchmarks would be preferred.
	- Changes
		- Provisions should be included to describe how to treat variations, provisional quantities and claims. Some variations may affect the completion of a stage and some may not. The stage payment schedule may be rendered impossible to implement if there are many variations affecting many stages. The administrative time to make and agree the adjustments may outweigh the time to do a normal quantity-and-rate valuation. If the amounts of stage payments are not rigidly fixed but are flexibly linked to the estimated final contract sum, the task will be easier.
- Differing features of activity schedule
	- Mechanism
		- Similar to stage payment but the activity schedules are prepared by tenderers and stages are in the form of activities usually with reference to their own programmes.
	- Basis of amounts payable
		- No BQ or pro-forma SOR need to be provided to tenderers. The risk of measurement errors are passed to Contractor. This will reduce the tender documentation time but will be more time consuming and costly for tenderers to prepare their tenders. A long tendering period may be required. The cost of tendering will be reflected in tender prices.
		- Each lump sum price does not have to be derived from the usual SMM compliant quantity and all-in rate build-up but can be derived directly from the costs of labour, materials and plant and can be inclusive of all ancillary work and costs more relevant to each activity. Varied quantities due to tenderers' own design can more easily be accommodated, and the design itself can become an activity
	- Relevant to programme
		- Activities can be more closely related to the programme activities of the Contractor. Tenderers have to plan the works very carefully before preparing the activity schedule. This may help ensure that the tender is more comprehensive giving greater confidence in the tender prices
	- Tender analysis
		- When the activity schedules are prepared by tenderers based on their own programme. It would be difficult to appreciate whether the price against an activity is reasonable or not as the constituent sub-activities may vary. A pro-forma activity schedule may help to some extent. A cap in the form of a percentage of the tender sum may be imposed upon some activities. However, this may limit the flexibility which is the purpose of activity schedule.
		- If no breakdown of each lump sum price is required to be submitted by the tenderers, it would be difficult to assess whether the quantities and rates are reasonable for the described activity, and there will be no rates for pricing variations. A quantity and rate breakdown may be required to be submitted with the tender. A provision needs to be added to stipulate the implications of the quantities and rates for pricing variations. Alternatively, a schedule of rates only may be required for pricing variations, but those rates may bear no relationship with those used in calculating in the lump sum price.
		- Given greater flexibility, tenderers may strategically re-allocate the prices to their advantage (e.g. front loading). Careful tender analysis should be conducted and any anomalies should be ironed out, but some client organisations would not accept post tender adjustments to suit.

## Question

Question No. 1 – Payment Valuation

You are the Consultant QS for the following project.

![Pasted image 20250413110811|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250413110811.png)

This morning, the Architect sent you the email below:

---

Dear PQS,

I refer to Fada’s interim payment application no. 28 submitted this morning for a net payment due of approximately HK $60M . Here are my comments on Fada’s application:

1. Fada applies for 90% work done for the podium exterior cladding. I accept that the site work is actually 90% done. However, Fada’s latest submitted shop drawings have not incorporated all my comments. Please value 50% instead of 90% . Also, I will instruct Fada to uninstall randomly a few panels for my inspection to ensure he followed the approved shop drawings.

2. One major item – AI No. 25 – Revised reinforcement details to ground floor beam B1-20 to B1-38 is missing from Fada’s application. All structural works have been completed.

3. The electrical nominated subcontractor is now arguing with Fada about Fada withholding HK$1,000,000 from his payment. The Employer is considering direct payment to this subcontractor to avoid any delay to the subcontract works caused by the unresolved payment dispute. I will update you as soon as possible the Employer’s decision and the amount of direct payment to the subcontractor. Please then adjust your valuation accordingly.

4. Last week, a worker fell from height and was seriously injured. I suggest a notional sum of, say, HK$1,000,000 should be held back until Fada’s report with prevention measures about the accident is submitted and approved by me. Please feel free to propose the sum you consider appropriate.

5. During the regular site meeting yesterday, Fada presented his latest construction programme, which shows a delay of 1 month. No doubt, Fada will pursue an extension of time. Meanwhile, please draft a statement to be stated on your valuation of this interim payment to clearly inform Fada the Employer’s right to deduct liquidated and ascertained damages from any payment due to Fada.
 
6. The children play equipment has been delivered to site. However, the equipment won’t be installed until the 34th month according to the Contractor’s programme. Should we pay now?

I would be grateful if you could respond to my comments.

Regards,

Architect

Please respond. Citation of contract clauses is not required.

## Assessor Notes

- Work done but drawing comment not addressed
	- Architect should review whether his comments were late for incorporation into the latest submitted shop drawings or late after the work had been done on site. If the work was done pursuant to the approved shop drawings current at the time, then subsequent changes should be regarded as VO.
	- Even if the approved shop drawings have not been strictly followed, only the non-compliant portion should be excluded from the payment valuation. The Architect should advise on the nature and extent of non-compliance to enable a proper valuation. The estimated value of the exterior cladding is quite significant. A reduction from 90% to 50% without any justification is not fair.
	- Opening up for inspection is permissible under the Contract. If the opening up probes that the work done is not in compliance with the approved shop drawings, the cost of opening up and making good should be borne by the Contractor, otherwise the costs should be borne by Employer under cl.8.2 of SFBC.
- VO not in payment application
	- Interim payment valuation should also include the value of variations properly done. The Contract does not have provision to limit the valuation to the items and amounts applied for by the Contractor.
- MC withhold NSC amount, direct payment
	- Direct payment can be made to NSC only if MC withholds certified payment without a good reason and without giving a prior notice to NSC. MC's failure should be ascertained and certified by Architect first before implementing direct payment. The direct payment is at the Employer's discretion and for the withheld certified amount only. GCC authorizes wider discretion to cover future payments under cl.29.8(3)
- Withhold for injury accident
	- Architect's recommended sum is more like a penalty to push the Contractor for a report on the accident. It does not represent the value of work not properly done nor the loss and expense suffered by Employer due to the accident. There is no specific price for the preparation of the accident report for deduction. Deduction of a notional sum without proven loss and expense is not permissible. The only possible deduction may be in respect of prices for safety measures not properly implemented.
- One month late in programme, remind LAD
	- There are still about 22 months until the contract completion date. EOT is still to be considered. Employer has not yet suffered any loss or expense due to the current delay. LAD can only be applied after contract completion date as reasonably extended when the Contractor still fails to complete the works. The Employer is not entitled to deduct any LAD now. While a declaration to reserve the Employer's right to deduct LAD is permissible, it is too premature to do so. Cl.24.
- Mos premature
	- The payment valuation can exclude materials delivered to site prematurely under cl.32.(2)(d)(ii). It seems that the children play equipment was brought to site prematurely when there are still 8 months until installation. This may be an attempt to save Contractor's own costs only. In principle, no payment should be made now until there are good reasons for early delivery for the benefit of the project, e.g. suiting seasonal production time, suiting bulk purchase in conjunction with Employer's other projects, etc. The Contractor should be asked to clarify.

#Variation 
## Question

Question No. 2 – Valuation of Variations

The contract completion date of the Main Contract of a smart building project in Central is 31 March 2019. The project is a part of the bigger entire development. After the award of the Contract, the Employer has engaged a direct contractor for the supply and installation of intelligent building management systems (“IBMS”) and the IBMS equipment was to be delivered to the Employer’s temporary storage yard in the rural area on 1 March 2019 for subsequent installation after the Main Contract works are completed.

In view of the extremely high value of the IBMS equipment and the remoteness of the temporary storage yard, the Architect upon request of the Employer issued an instruction (A.I. No. 33) to the Contractor (known as “ABC Contractor”) to state that:

“Please provide additional security guards at the Employer’s temporary storage yard from 1 March 2019 to the completion of the Main Contract works to watch over the IBMS equipment on 24-hour full time basis.”

After increasing the security guards as required in A.I. No. 33, the progress of the Works was delayed by 60 days due to the following reasons:

(a) 20 days - Additional signal cable instructed by the Architect for which 20 days’ EOT was granted; and  
(b) 40 days - Use of non-compliant switch box by the Contractor for which no EOT was granted

As a consequence of the above delays, the deployment period of additional security guards was extended by 60 days accordingly.

You are the Consultant QS of the project. The Contractor has submitted a proposed valuation of A.I. No. 33 (see Appendix A). The Architect has requested you to provide comments on the proposed valuation, in particular, the validity of the following aspects:

(a) Provision of standby security guards;  
(b) Use of star rates after 31 March 2019; and  
(c) Payment for the security guards deployed during different delayed periods.

Please advise the Architect in a letter and explain your reasons with reference to relevant contract provisions. Detailed assessment is not required.

## Assessor Notes

- Provision of standby security guards
	- The instruction is not specific as to the number of guards to be provided
	- It should be checked whether there have been subsequent clarification as to the number of guards to be provided. The clarified staffing requirements should be used for the variations.
	- If there have been no clarifications, then the relevant facts and the reasonableness of providing the standby guards should be checked
	- Any full-time guard would need to take meal beaks, go to toilet, take statutory holidays, take sick leaves, takes casual leaves, leave the place for other emergency causes, etc. It is reasonable that two guards or a standby guard is required for a shift
	- If the storage yard is big or there is more than one access or there are insufficient physical security measures, it is reasonable to provide more than one guard at any time
	- The actual duty time of the day and night shifts and the principal and standby guards should be clarified and substantiated by attendance records and payroll records to see how the standby guards' times interacted with the principal guards' time, and to see whether the daily rates should be the same for the principal guards and standby guards.
	- Contract rates have been used. The applicability of the contract rates should be reviewed
- Use of star rates after contract completion date
	- According to cl.13.4(1) , contract rates should be used for valuation of variation of similar character executed under similar physical working conditions. If the character is similar but the conditions are changed, the contract rates should be adjusted for the difference in the conditions
	- On the other hand, the contract rates are for work executed on the contract site and are not binding for unanticipated work outside the site whether or not of similar working conditions. The provision of the security guards outside site is outside scope of works especially when the equipment is not for use in the Contract nor entirely for use under this project, the contract rates are not binding
	- Putting aside the question of binding or not, the temporary storage yard is very remote from the contract site. The working conditions at the temporary storage yard can be very different from those on the contract site making it unfair to use the contract rates as the base for adjustment. The Contractor is entitled to ask for star rates instead of contract rates or adjusted contract rates
	- Furthermore, the contract rates are for work carried out within the original contract period. If a piece of contract work or variation is required to be carried out after the original contract period due to reasons for which the Employer is responsible, Contractor is entitled to ask for an adjustment to the contract rates or claim loss and expense under cl. 27.1.
	- Even if the contract rats were originally reasonable, possible reasons for the cost increase are: wage increase from the middle of the original applicable period to the period after original completion date, change of guards or security company, etc.
	- In summary, Contractor can ask for star rate throughout
	- Bonus: strangely, Contractor has used some contract rates for valuing the days before original completion date without asking for star rates or adjusted contract rates, but only asked for star rates after original completion date. It may be possible that the quoted contract rates are not for work of the same description but are those which have already accounted for the change in working conditions for days not later than original contract date. In that case, both the reasonableness of the quoted contract rates and the star rates should be examined.
	- Bonus: if may also be possible that the quoted contract rates have not already accounted for the change in working conditions for days not later than original completion date but the Contractor is prepared to be bound by them and only wants to ask for star rates for the days after. In that case, the reasonableness of star rates should be examined.
	- When contract rates or star rates have been used, there should be no reasons to add another 15% mark-up for overheads and profit at the end. When star rates have been used, examination of the same is required to see if profit and overheads have been included
- Payment for security guards deployed during different delayed periods
	- Along with the delayed completion, Contractor had no choice but to continue with the provision of security guards until the completion of the works in order to comply with AI. The real question to address is whether Contractor is entitled to payment for the different delayed period
	- Excusable delay - the addition of signal cable is a variation entitling to L&E compensation, so there should no be any disagreement as to whether payment for guards for the 20 days' EOT should be made. However, instead of invoking the L&E clause, the VO should take in account the full impact of EOT. (cl.27.1(2)(c))
	- Culpable delay - generally, there should be no L&E compensation for prolonged period due tot he Contractor's own delay. It may therefore be argued that Contractor should not be entitled to payment for the 40 days' culpable delay.
	- L&E compensation generally refers to compensation of loss and expense due to causes over and above the risks for which the Contractor should have the opportunity to allow for in the Contract Sum. If the risks belong to the Contractor, no L&E compensation will be made. There would be no L&E compensation in respect of the provision of guards on site which is a contract work.
	- However, the need to provide additional guards outside the site is not within the scope of original Contract. The Contractor could not have allowed for the risks of the his own delay sin respect of the guards outside site in the Contract Sum. The instruction did not specify a fixed period, it should have reasonably expected that the period is floating and Contractor would be expecting payment for floating period. If the instruction did specify a fixed period, EOT of fixed period would need another instruction 
	- If it is expressly stated that in the original or additional instruction that any extended guarding period due to the Contractor's fault should be borne by Contractor, the Contractor will likely follow the argument for star rates above that the instruction is beyond the scope of the works and can be refused.

You are the Consultant QS for a minor works contract for the construction of a rain shelter beside the running track of a sportsground. On Day 40 of construction, the Architect issued an instruction requiring a variation to the substructure works which necessitated 10 extra days for the construction of the substructure works.

On the other hand, the Contractor has encountered technical issues on Day 60 on the transportation of the fabricated rain shelter to the site which also delayed the completion of the Works.

The Architect approached you and would like your advice on the Contractor’s entitlement to extension of time, if any. The requirements for notice of delays and claims can be ignored.

The Baseline Programme and the As-built Programme are given below: -

## Assessor Notes

- Identify - A comparison between the two programmes shows:
	- Overall completion delayed by 15 days
	- Substructure construction increased from 30 days to 40 days by 10 days - on its own, it is on the critical path to the overall completion and would cause 10 days' delay
	- Fabrication of rain shelter increased from 60 days to 85 days by 25 days - on its own, after using up the original float of 10 days, the critical delay to the overall completion would be 15 days
- With hindsight, this may be very tempting to argue that Contractor should be responsible for the overall delay of 15 days. However, such a retrospective approach will often lead to a misinterpretation of the changing critical path
- In principle, EOT should be granted as soon as the cause of delay starts to affect the progress to the extent that the effect of the delay can be estimated, with possible continual review of EOT. The effects of many delays should be assessed individually, and each should be taken in a prospective manner as much as possible taking the situation existing at the time when the cause of delay starts to affect the progress.
- The extended completion date promptly certified by Architect can be incorporated into the programme to serve as a new target for the remaining work. This would assist the Contractor who is obliged to update the programme to realistically reflect the latest situation.
- Delay to substructure
	- At about day 40, the variation to the substructure works was expected to require 10 extra days for construction
	- The substructure was on the critical path to the overall completion
	- The 10 extra days would delay the overall completion by 10 days
	- The delay to fabrication did not happen yet and was irrelevant
	- EOT of 10 days should be granted 
	- If promptly granted and the programme updated, the original float time for fabrication of rain shelter would be increased from 10 days to 20 days, and the shelter erection should start on day 71+10 = day 81
- A diagram is expected to illustrate the above
- Delay to the fabrication
	- On day 60, the transportation problem started to happen, but there was some float time
	- On day 70, the float time had all been used up but the delivery was still not finished
	- On day 85, the delivery was finished
	- The start of shelter erection was delayed from day 81 to day 86 for 5 days
	- The overall completion delay was 5 days due to Contractor
	- No EOT should be granted
- A diagram is expected to illustrate the above

## Question

Question No. 4 – Phased Completion

You are the QS of Jufu Contracting Ltd. Jufu is the Contractor for the renovation of a 2-level shopping mall. The area of renovation is 1500m2×2 levels. The Commencement Date is 1 June 2019. Sectional Completion is stated in the Contract as follows:

Completion of Section 1: Ground floor, 1 September 2019 Completion of Section 2: First floor, 31 October 2019 
Section 1 was completed on time and is now in operation.

At the weekly progress meeting on 6 September 2019:

(a) The Employer requested Jufu to repair the wooden floor on Ground Floor damaged by bursting of an existing cold water pipe the night before.  

(b) The Employer said he was considering to split Section 2 into two phases i.e. Section 2A to complete on 30 September 2019 and Section 2B to complete on 31 October 2019. Section 2A will then be opened for early operation. Jufu’s construction manager considers the arrangement feasible without causing delay to the overall completion.

Jufu’s construction manager asks for your contractual advice regarding the Employer’s request and any cost implication that Jufu needs to consider.

Please write a memo to the construction manager with your advice.

## Assessor Notes

- Damage to works after completion
	- MC should firstly find out the cause and the party responsible for the bursting of the existing cold water pipe
	- As it is an existing cold water pipe, it is unlikely that MC is responsible for providing it, but it should be checked whether MC has done anything affecting it so as to cause the bursting
	- According to cl.17.6, bursting of pipes after substantial completion is a specified peril relieving the Contractor from responsibility. However, it should not be interpreted to exclude intentional or accident acts on the part of Contractor.
	- Bonus: the standard clause has not addressed the issue of bursting caused by improper materials or workmanship on the part of the Contractor before substantial completion.
	- If MC is not responsible, MC may refuse to carry out the remedial work after substantial completion of the relevant section. If MC would like to do it, to avoid doubt, MC should ask Employer for a clear written instruction with an understanding to pay. The work may be treated as a variation or a separate order.
- Early possession of completed work
	- SFBC
		- Cl.18.1(1) - Employer may, with Contractor's consent, take possession of a part of the works, i.e. relevant part, before completion of the works
		- Cl.18.1(2) - Architect shall issue a certificate identifying the scope of the relevant part, giving relevant date for possession and stating the estimated amount of the relevant part
		- Cl.18.2 - substantial completion of the relevant part shall be deemed to have occurred on the relevant date and the following shall take effect:
			- Commencement of DLP
			- Exemption from liability for damage by specified peril
			- Release of retention on-half relating to the relevant part
		- Cl.2.1(1)(h) - Contractor's responsibility for the care of relevant part shall cease 14 days after possession
	- Although partial possession would not cause any overall delay, MC may incur additional costs arising from the following:
		- Provision of temporary measures to separate between Section 2A and 2B, in the form of hoarding, fencing, directory sign, etc.
		- Provision of temporary separate accesses to Section 2A and 2B, and provision of protection, signage, security, etc along the accesses
		- Risk and insurance for other people using access passing through Section 2B still in construction to Section 2A in operation
		- Maintenance and final removal of temporary measures and reinstatement of permanent work
		- Relocation of any temporary stores, site offices, plant, temporary lighting and power supply, etc.
		- Difficulties with logistics on site, re-sequencing of work to suit the early possession of Section 2A
		- Provision of other appropriate health and safety measures to deal with risks and nuisance caused by work in Section 2B to Section 2A
	- While the clause regarding partial possession have not specifically dealt with the occurrence of the above costs, the relevant work can be put forward as a variation under Contract as the definition of variation is wide enough to cover any imposition of an obligation or restriction instructed by Architect regarding access, working space, limitation of working hours, and sequence of work according to cl.1.6 
	- In case of SFBC, Contractor would have a better chance to negotiate a complete deal with all the required measures stipulated because of the need for the Contractor's consent

## Question

Question No. 1 – Feasibility Study

You are the consultant QS employed by Hong Kong Modern University for a feasibility study for a new build technology research centre on the campus.

![Pasted image 20250413111438|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250413111438.png)

The recent site investigation indicated that rock slope excavation will likely be encountered during basement construction. However, the adjoining conditions cannot permit the basement to be moved away from the slope. This morning, two options of basement construction were discussed among the Director of Campus Development and the consultant team. Refer to Attachment A for the Architect’s sketch of the two options, namely, Option A and Option B.

Option A – Both basement floors B1 and B2 are identical in length and width.

Option B – Basement floor B1 is bigger than B2. The total CFA is kept the same.

You are requested to advise on the ballpark estimates of the differences in the construction costs of Option B as compared with Option A. The differences will be considered together with the pros and cons on the operational side of the options. Please reply by an email to the Director of Campus Development and the consultant team and attach the build-up of the estimates showing the items of physical differences with cost effects as compared with Option A. There is no need to prepare a total cost estimate for the building or the basement.

As advised by the consulting engineer, a pipe pile wall can be assumed for both options. For answering this question, you may use a composite rate of HK$8,000/m² of wall area measured flat on elevation. The foundation type of both options will be a combination of raft slabs and footings. Foundation piling will only be required for the left 40m² area not resting directly on the rock profile and can be assumed to be the same for both options.

## Question

Question No. 2 – Sustainability

You are the Assistant QS Manager of Ring Development Ltd (Ring). Ring is going to develop a new shopping centre.

| Location               | Tai Po                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| CFA                    | 9,000m2                 |
| No. Of storeys         | 3 storeys, each 3,000m2 |
| Current project status | Conceptual Design       |

Ring’s Project Director would like to seek your advice on the following two issues:

A. As a “green” initiative, it is proposed to install photo voltaic panels (also called PV panels) on the roof. Please list the heads of costs (also called “cost categories” according to International Construction Measurement Standards “ICMS”) in the evaluation of the life cycle costs using PV panels, and give three drawbacks or risks of this initiative for further review prior to confirmation to proceed.  

B. Fresh water-cooled air conditioning system is used in the current scheme. As the site is close to the seafront, Ring is studying the alternative scheme of seawater cooling by using seawater intake from an existing seawater pump house nearby. Please list the major items that should be considered in the cost comparison between the current scheme and the alternative scheme. Given no details, you need not estimate the cost difference. The list will be used for further discussion with the design team in order to determine which scheme is more cost effective.

Your reply by a memo to the Project Director later today would be useful for further discussion.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- PV panel
	- Heading
		- Capital or investment cost mainly comprising supply and installation of PV panels and associated structural and building services installation
		- Renewal / replacement cost

		- Upgrading of existing filtration plant, chemical dosing system, electrical system and other pumping accessories if the existing provisions are not sufficient
		- Civil / structural works for potential expansion or modification of pump house to accommodate new equipment
		- Programme implication due to the lead time required for statutory submission and approval before the general building plan approval
		- Land lease premium implications
		- Programme implications due to the time required for statutory submission, approval and consent during construction, the time required to carry out the additional items, and the possible risks of delays beyond controls
	- Substitutions
		- Differences in substructure designs to accommodate the pipe entering and leaving
		- Differences in pipework, pie fittings, pipe trenches, pipe ducts, building services within site up to the chiller plant
		- Differences between the equipment for the two systems, e.g. omission of cooling tower
		- Differences in architectural layout with potential repositioning of chiller plant room
		- Life expectancy and life cycle cost difference between the two systems

## Question

Question No. 3 – Tender Preparation

You are the consultant QS of a project for the construction of a new lift tower at a shopping centre in Kowloon Bay. The Tender Documents are to be issued on 16 October 2020. The tender shall be “Lump Sum” with Bills of Quantities (BQ) using HKSMM (without amendments by Preambles).

Your senior has just sent you a message below.

---

Hi QS,

The following two documents were received from the design team this morning:

1. Drawing No. APC–ST–01 – General notes of the structural works. This drawing will be further developed for the first submission for the Buildings Department (BD) approval. See Attachment A.

2. A schedule of quantities for structural steel members and bolts generated from the Building Information Modelling (BIM) model given by the design consultant. See Attachment B.

Through a quick scan, I clouded those notes on the drawing which I believe that they are inconsistent or incomplete, and queries should be raised with the design team to clarify. Unfortunately, I am rushing for a meeting and cannot now go through with you the details nor the schedule of quantities.

Please prepare the queries about the inconsistencies or incompleteness of the clouded notes on the drawing and the schedule of quantities for discussion in the tender coordination meeting later this afternoon.

What care should be exercised when using schedule of quantities of structural steel members generated from the BIM models for preparing BQ? Give three points.

Thanks.

Senior QS

## Assessor Notes

- Query to general notes (in RFI format)
	- Characteristic strength of ribbed steel reinforcing bars weaker than plain reinforcing bars?
	- Missing 12mm and 16mm diameters of rebars in the alp length table?
	- 35mm diameter of rebars shown in the lap length table should be 32mm?
	- Lap length of reinforcement in the table: TL (anchorage length under tension) less than CL (anchorage length under compression)?
	- Concrete grades of beam and slab far greater than those of column and structural wall / parapet wall?
	- Concrete grade of footing same as non-structural normal?
	- Concrete grade of mass concrete fill C15/20 far below normal?
	- Concrete grade of structural wall / parapet wall less than non-structural elements?
	- Concrete grade of lift shaft far less than water tank?
	- Which concrete locations are waterproofing construction?
	- Concrete cover: cast against soil less than on blinding?
	- Concrete cover for 120 mins FRR less than that for 60 min FRR
	- What are the FRR requirements for the steel structure and its FRR painting
- Quantity of struct steel & bolts generated from BIM
	- For the dimensional parts of the type names, are they in compliance with which naming standard? For the last dimensions, which are the kg/m and which are the thickness of the members? In case of kg/m, are the full details of the sectional sizes available from the naming standard? In case of thickness, should both webs and flanges (e.g. rolled steel channel RSC) be stated according to the naming standard?
	- Are the lengths the overall end-to-end cut-lengths of each member counted? Lengths are missing from rolled equal angle EA, rolled steel channel RSC and universal column UC.
	- For circular hollow section CHS 150x150x12.5, what is meant by 150x150?
	- For steel plate PL 200x200, if 200x200 means the cross section, it is unreasonably thick.
	- For square hollow section, SHS 150x150x125, 125 is too big for kg/m or thickness
	- The types represent the sectional types. Can the members be further classified by their functional names like: columns, beams, bracings, purlins, and cladding rails, grillages, built-up columns, built-up trusses and griders?
	- Are all the members straight, and not castellated, tapered, curved or cambered?
	- Are all connection plates included?
	- What are the locations and more details description of the bolts given in the schedule of quantities, while noting that "all steel structure shall be connected with 10,mm fillet weld all round" as stated in General Note?
- Care to be exercised
	- The classification and naming conventions should be sufficient for QS to refer to the dwg and spec to classify and fully describe the shape, dimension, materials and workmanship, etc according to HKSMM
	- The length given should be overall end-to-end cut-length of each piece of steel member
	- The weight per m can be looked up from standard tables or calculated based on the names or sectional sizes given in schedule of quantities
	- More detailed schedule showing individual members with their locational references should be provided to enable checking for more detailed classification or descriptions according to HKSMM and to enable checking of no overlap or shortage or omission of members in the model or the summary schedule
	- A decision has to be made as to whether to adopt the schedule of quantities for BQ quantities. If the schedule of quantities is found to be trustworthy, the quantities may be converted with suitable adjustments for use as BQ quantities. If the schedule is too crude, the quantities may only be used for bulk checking. A floor by floor analysis would be useful for bulk checking

## Question

Question No. 4 – Tender Queries

You are the consultant QS for a new 30-storey service apartment in Kennedy Town. The tenders for the Main Contract were returned three weeks ago. It will be a lump sum contract with Bills of Quantities (BQ). The Employer intends to award the contract to the lowest tenderer by this week. However, prior to the award, the Employer would like to address the time and cost implications of the following issues with the lowest tenderer by tender queries:

1. Due to a lot of missing rebar details during BQ preparation, the rebars are measured as provisional in the BQ. The structural engineer has just completed the rebar details and the Employer would like to include them as part of the tender drawings.
2. Early handover of lower floors 4/F-15/F to the Employer for operation trial run is required.

Your assistant has drafted the following tender queries to address the above additional requirements:

| Ref No. | Query                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A       | Refer to the attached structural drawings showing the rebar details. Please confirm there will be no time and cost implications on your tender. |
| B       | Early handover of lower floors 4/F-15/F is required. Please confirm there will be no time and cost implications on your tender.                 |

You consider that the matter should not be that simple especially item B would require a lot more information. Please write down your consideration, suggestions and clarifications which may need to be raised with the Employer and the consultant team in order to obtain a proper answer from the tenderer.

[14 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Additional rebar details
	- Would one week be sufficient for the tenderer to measure the additional re-bar details? Should be more  time be given to the tenderer for review and reply?
	- Has the QS formed any view as to the differences between the provisional quantities and full re-bar details? If there is possible saving, why ask for no cost implication? If there is possible addition, it would not be fair to the tenderer to ask for no cost implication
	- If QS has not formed any view yet and if the tenderer can readily accept no cost implication, it may mean that the provisional quantities are very generous. This will be to the Employer's disadvantages. QS may be blamed if the Employer discovers later that the provisional quantities are generous.
	- Has the Employer insisted that there should be no cost and time implications? The Employer should accept if the tenderer refuses to accept no cost and time implications since there are in fact additional rebar details.
	- If the Employer accepts giving more time for tenderer to review and reply and accepts cost and time adjustments, then the above problems can be resolved, but he may need to involve the second lowest tenderer as a fallback choice.
	- If the Employer does not want to defer the award, then a better arrangement without putting unnecessary risk on either party is to issue the additional rebar details and request the tenderer to confirm that the tendered unit rates and committed construction period are still valid considering any complexity or additional quantities introduced by the additional rebar details. The provisional quantities may be adjusted to cover any possible addition but are still subject to final remeasurement.
	- Bonus: as the latest drawings are still being review, further revisions may be required. Changing the provisional quantities now to lump sums may still be subject to future variations
	- Bonus: should the question be restricted to additional rebar details? Do the drawings contain other revisions apart from the additional rebar details? The scope and extent of revisions would need to be assessed.
- Early handover of 4/F-15/F
	- 4/F - 15/F is a substantial portion of the works. Early handover of operational trail run as a service apartment would mean handover of possession and custody of the areas so handed over, and would amount to sectional completion
	- For sectional completion, there should be definite sectional completion contract clauses detailing the consequences
	- Details regarding the following would need to be clarified with Employer and consultant team and stated in the PTQ:
		- Exact areas to be handed over
		- Scope of permanent works whether within or outside 4/F - 15/F required to be completed before handover
		- Temporary works and services (indoor hoarding, fencing, directional signs, lifts, temporary or permanent water and electricity supply and consumption charges), required to be completed before handover and continued to be provided after handover until completion of the whole of the works
		- Provision and protection of access routes to those floors by people other than workers under the Contractor's responsibilities
		- Any need for temporary occupation permit
		- Arrangement for Contractor to come back to carry out outstanding or defects rectification work
		- Final testing and commissioning of E&M services close to the completion of the whole of the works
		- Time to complete and handover
		- Rate of LAD for the section handed over and the remaining works
		- Insurance arrangement
		- Whether the amount of the bond will be reduced after handover
		- How would DLP be calculated?
	- Such extent of early handover would not have no time or cost implications.

#LossExpense 
## Question

Question No. 1 – Waiving Loss and/or Expense

Assume yourself either as a consultant QS or a contractor QS. A contract handled by you contains the following clause: -

“Notwithstanding anything provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall not be entitled to claim any direct loss and/or expense incurred, in respect of any matter for which the first 90 calendar days of extension of time has been granted by the Architect under the Contract.”

Your Client or your Director, as the case may be, would like to know:

(1) the purpose of the clause;  
(2) whether the clause is enforceable;  
(3) whether the denominator should also take into account the 90 calendar days when valuing time-related preliminaries in interim payments and assessing loss and expense claims;  
(4) whether there would be any difference if this clause was only agreed as a concession during post tender negotiations; and  
(5) whether there can be other types of direct loss and/or expense not covered by this clause.

Please advise your Client by a letter / Please advise your Director by a memo.

## Assessor Notes

- Purpose
	- Reduce the risk of budget overrun, enhance final cost certainty, and reduce time to resolve L&E claim by requiring Contractor to allow for or absorb the direct L&E so described in the clause
- Enforceability
	- The clause is not prohibited by statutory laws. So long as the clause is agreed between the contract parties with not duress or undue influence. It will be enforceable.
	- Bonus: whether the clause is clear enough to achieve the intended purpose is anther matter
	- EOT must be granted as usual for the clause to work
- Denominator
	- IP assessment whether put waiver period
		- Normally, time-related preliminaries are required by special preliminaries clause to be valued as work-related. If they are permitted to be valued as time-related, the denominator would normally be the contract period. This may mean that any allowance for the risks would be paid earlier than the occurrence of the risks
		- Bonus: in the absence of the clause, Contractor would still have to allow for the L&E in respect of EOT without corresponding L&E compensation and in respect of his own delays, and IP valuation would not put his risk allowance in the denominator
		- After the occurrence of delays, the denominator would normally be the realistic prolonged contract period. Payments for the risk allowance would be spread out.
	- L&E assessment whether put waiver period
		- L&E claims should in principle be valued based on the actual costs incurred or likely to be incurred irrespective of the preliminaries prices. Therefore, the risk allowance in the preliminaries prices would not matter. However, if it is agreed that the preliminaries prices can be used for assessing L&E, whether the risk allowance should be considered in the denominator would need discussion. 
		- Contractor may argue that 
			- Even though he was given the opportunity to allow for the risks, he has not actually allowed any costs, and therefore, any increase of the denominator to include 90 days would be inappropriate
			- Risk allowance is not in preliminaries but in the measured works. Once the measured works are done, they should be paid in full except for the retention percentage.
	- Concession during tender negotiation
		- If the clause is agreed as a concession during tender negotiation with no change to the tender sum, the Contractor will have a stronger ground to say that he has actually not allowed any costs but would take the risk to absorb the costs.
	- Other L&E
		- Contractor's entitlement to L&E and that to EOT are governed by two separate contract clauses under cl.26 & 25.
		- Under SFBC, some events are entitled to EOT only but no L&E. L&E clause covers not only prolongation but also disruption L&E.
		- There might be causes in which Contractor has incurred L&E due to disruption to an activity of works with no impact on completion date. Such cases would not have EOT, and L&E would not be precluded by waiver clause.
		- The Contractor may try not to claim EOT but claim disruption L&E to escape from waiver clause
		- Contractor may try to argue that L&E is partly related to prolongation and partly related to disruption. However, the words "any L&E incurred in respect of any matter for which the first 90 days of EOT" would be wide enough to cover any L&E in respect of that matter, and could therefore cover prolongation as well as disruption once that matter is entitled to EOT.
		- If the words are "any L&E incurred in respect of the first 90 days of EOT", then disruption L&E can escape from the waiver clause
		- L&E beyond the first 90 days of EOT are not waived.
		- The clause does not exclude a claim for common law damages

## Question

Question No. 2 – Contractor’s Programme

You are the consultant QS for the refurbishment of two blocks of 18-storey residential flats (Block 1 and Block 2) in Sai Kung. In accordance with the Contract, the Employer shall firstly hand over Block 1 to the Contractor. Block 2 shall be handed over to the Contractor 20 weeks after the date for commencement of Block 1. The completion period of each block is 19 weeks with liquidated damages payable for delayed completion.

The baseline programme (given in Annex Q2) submitted by the Contractor had already been approved by the Architect prior to handover. A series of events as below happened during the progress of the Works and the Contractor had served valid notices of claim for extension of time and/or loss and expense in accordance with the Contract:

A Block 1 was one week’s late in handover to the Contractor. The Contractor asked for one week’s extension of time and reimbursement for loss and expense on the basis of postponement of possession of the site. The Architect contended that only part of the initial site establishment was affected.  

B The first batch of kitchen cabinets for Block 1 supplied by the Employer was found not fitting in the kitchens and required alterations. The Contractor was instructed to make alterations to these kitchen cabinets and to request the kitchen cabinets supplier to make alterations to the remaining kitchen cabinets. The Contractor asked for two weeks’ extension of time and monetary compensation for the works involved.  

C Flats 137 to 140 on 19/F of Block 2 were handed over to the Contractor four weeks earlier than that stipulated in the Contract. The Architect instructed the Contractor to start the refurbishment works at these flats and hand over to the Employer two weeks later. The Contractor made application for loss and expense due to work being out of phase. The Architect contended that, by bringing forward some works in Block 2, the project could have been completed earlier with a saving in site preliminaries costs.

The Architect requested you to advise by a letter on the Contractor’s contractual positions with reference to the contract provisions. You are however not required to assess the amount of extension of time and loss and expense entitlement to the Contractor, nor required to state the detailed procedures to deal with the claims.

## Assessor Notes

- Delayed handover
	- The event was a postponement of Date for Possession of the site which would entitle the Contractor to EOT for critical delay so caused under SFBC cl.25.1(3)(j)(i), and related L&E under cl.27.1(2)(e)(i) or (2)(k)
	- Contractor is required to complete the refurbishment works within 19 weeks for Block 1. Any delay in the handover would have full impact on the Contractor's progress to complete on time. The delay was therefore critical. EOT should be granted to the Contractor for one week's delay of handover.
	- However, since no site establishment work would have carried out by Contractor before handover, L&E related to site establishment should be minimal and negligible. Contractor might incur some project staff cost, overheads and inflation.
	- Bonus: it is normal for LOA not to specify the actual handover / commencement date to give flexibility. The actual date will be stated in the Contract only if it is signed after the actual commencement date.
- Alteration of kitchen cabinets
	- Alteration of kitchen cabinets supplied by Employer would amount to a variation addition, particularly when the alteration was as instructed. The time pending the instruction may be regarded as a failure of Employer to supply on time.
	- An instructed variation addition would entitle Contractor to additional payment as variation under cl.13.3(a). EOT for critical delay so caused (cl.25.1(3)(h)), and related L&E (cl.27.1(2)(c))
	- In addition, a failure of Employer to supply would entitle Contractor to EOT for critical delay so caused (cl.25.1(3)(r)) and L&E (cl.27.1(2)(j))
	- However, it should be noted from baseline programme that work to the subsequent floor can only start one week after the start of the work to the preceding floor. This means that work to the preceding floor in the 2nd week would not be critical to the subsequent floor except for the last floor. If the kitchen cabinets were not required to be completed within the 1st week and only the 1st batch was affected, it is likely that the delays caused by the alteration work would not be critical to the completion of Block 1 leading to EOT. No prolongation costs or L&E would be incurred. Some disruptive costs might be incurred when dealing with the alteration, which may be included in variation.
- Advancing flat 137-140 on 19/F of Block 2
	- According to the approved baseline programme, Contractor would have started work at Block 2 only after the works at Block 1 were completed. The change of programme requirement by Employer means that the four flats in Block 2 were started four weeks earlier than the rest of Block 2 and were expected to be completed within two weeks concurrent with the works to Block 1. This would be followed by a time gap of two weeks before the start of the rest of Block 2.
	- By putting the work out of phase, there will be additional cost incurred by Contractor because:
		- A loss of efficiency and productivity as there could be extra mobilization of resources for the four flats in advance of the rest of Block 2, with reduced volume of work limited to four flats instead of eight flats on 19/F
		- Extra separation, cleaning and protection costs upon completion of the first four flats
	- Furthermore, after the completion of the first four flats, there would still be four flats on 19/F of Block 2 to complete. The overall time to complete the first four flats and the rest of Block 2 should be more than original 19 weeks. There would not be any saving in the site preliminaries. On the contrary, there would be prolongation costs incurred by Contractor.
	- Bonus: SFBC do not have provisions for Employer to order advancement of commencement date of a part or section of the works. If the Employer requires Contractor to start part earlier than, then Contract will have the right to object, and consequently have the chance to negotiate for monetary compensation for the inefficiencies due to the overlap.
	- Bonus: the approved baseline programme shows that the works at Block 2 will only start after completion of the works of Block 1. This might have been the original intention. However, Contract only says Block 2 will be handed over to the Contractor 20 weeks after the date for commencement of Block 1. It does not say that it must be after the completion of Block 1. If the constraint causing the apparent linkage can be removed, the Employer will have the right to ask Contractor to start Block 2 in week 20 without being affected by any delay in Block 1. The Contractor may argue that the overlap could cause him loss of efficiencies and productivity, but since delays to Block 1 are always possible but Contract has not stipulated no overlap, the Contractor cannot claim any L&E. Contractor also has an obligation to mitigate the consequence of delay to Block 1. By not correspondingly delaying the start of Block 2 can help mitigate. 
	- Bonus: since Block 2 is only a part of whole of the works, Employer may request delay recovery proposals to recover the delay to Block 1 by advancing the commencement of Block 2. SFBC cl.26 gives such a mechanism. The eventual results under SFBC are subject to mutual negotiation and agreement. 
	- Usually, the contractors would be co-operative to advance as far as practicable. In the present case, Contractor has complied with the instruction without objection, then the commencement of Block 2 should be deemed to have commenced on the commencement of the first floor flats. EOT would need to be granted for the extra four weeks with monetary compensation for the longer construction period as if the event is a variation under cl.13.3(a). The monetary compensation could take into account some savings when resources were shared between Block 1 and 2 during their overlap period. Other additional cost such as loss of efficiency and productivity as well as extra separation, cleaning and protection costs mentioned above are reimbursable.
	- If the Architect considers that the official commencement date should not count the first four flats, Contractor is still entitled to have 19 weeks to complete the rest of Block 2. Architect cannot under Contract unilaterally reduce the time by reason of separating and advancing a part of the works. The liability for monetary compensation would remain the same as that stated.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Relief Measures

You are the consultant QS for a residential development with a contract period of 36 months. Now in the 16th month, the Contractor has just informed the Employer that he has been encountering difficulty in cashflow due to the recent and continuing crisis of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and asked for the Employer’s assistance on the cashflow as interim relief measures.

The Employer would tend to help the Contractor but would like to assess all the risks and the possible ways of relieving the Contractor’s financial burden. The Employer’s Project Manager would like to seek your advice on the following aspects:

A. Risks to the Employer of granting assistance and not granting assistance.  

B. A minimum of six suggestions to the Employer as interim cashflow relief measures for the Employer’s consideration.  

Please advise the Project Manager by a letter.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Risk of granting assistance
	- There is a possibility of overpayment if Contractor finally goes bankrupt or liquidated before completion of works
	- Financial assistance provided by Employer may be used by Contractor on other projects instead of financing this project
	- Although Employer's financial assistance intends to improve the financial condition of Contractor, it is difficult to ensure such assistance to the Contractor can also be passed to all subcon or supplier, whose may also encounter financial difficulties
- Risk of not granting assistance
	- Contractor may delay or cut down payments to his subcon, supplier, workers, or even his own staff who may subsequently slow down or suspend their works. Inevitably, the progress of work will be adversely affected.
	- Quality of works could also be affected as Contractor or subcon will reduce their resources deployed on the project due to financial difficulties or frustration of not being paid
	- Severe cashflow problem may cause quicker insolvency or liquidation
	- In both cases, extra time and costs will be incurred in procuring another contractor to complete the works, and the extra costs may not be fully covered by the surety bond available.
- Interim cashflow relief measures
	- Review whether there have been under valuation of work done, MOS, variations, pro qty and claims, and improve if found
	- Review whether the usual practice of paying time-related prelim prices as work-related has been adopted and adjust it to more closely reflect the actual cash flow pattern of Contractor. Review whether the rather unusual practice of spreading insurance and bond premia over the contract period for payment has been adopted, and pay the premia as actually paid
	- Increase frequency of payments, for example, instead of monthly payments, adopt biweekly payment to improve cashflow
	- Shorten the time to value, certify and honour payments
	- Quickly assess variations, remeasure pro qty, and assess EOT and monetary claims not yet assessed to see whether there can be more money to be released
	- Change monthly progress payment to pre-agreed milestone payment to reduce time of valuation and onward certification and honouring certificates. However, this may not be of immediate help
	- Make direct payments for material off-site or on-site to the relevant subcon and supplier, and sign agreements to retain Employer's title to the properties, and to relieve Contractor's liability to pay them, but still holding the Contractor liable for safety custody on site, keeping identification of ownership, and requiring the procurement of insurances against loss of or damage to off-site materials. This will ensure the Employer can retain the ownership even when Contractor goes bankrupt. If Contractor can survive, the final account can make adjustment for the payment made by Employer
	- Issue cheques through Contractor to subcon or workers in need but stating them as beneficiaries. Contractor has to sign receipt of the payment as if actually paid to him under Contract, but he cannot pocket the cheque payment for his own use. This is different from direct payment for materials since no clear property title can be retained, and this keeps the privity of contract intact.
	- Make advance payment to Contractor to meet his own needs other than those satisfied by direct payment for materials or cheque payments to subcon or workers. There should be an agreement for the times and mode of recovery of the advance payments. This should be the last resort wince this would mean over-payment. All the preceding measures would not incur over-payment. Security such as advance payment bonds and personal guarantees from the Contractor's shareholders or senior management may be demanded from the Contractor, and are to be released when the advance payments are recovered. Parent company guarantee or property mortgage is unlikely to be obtained.

## Question

Question No. 4 – Abortive Work

You are the contractor QS of Guma Construction Ltd (Guma) formed in a few years ago. Guma has recently been awarded the main contract for the construction of a new 30-storey residential building with a contract period of 36 months. During the internal weekly project meeting, Guma’s Project Manager said the costs of abortive work in Guma’s previous project of similar scale were not recoverable due to improper management. Lessons learnt, the Project Manager requested Guma’s project team to discuss the strategy regarding abortive work for the new project in the next internal meeting. On the contractual side, he would like you to answer the following questions:

A. Is the Contractor entitled to claim additional payment for abortive work under the Contract? Please give examples of abortive work which are valid for requesting additional payment and which are not, one for each. State the contract clause for entitlement.  

B. What are the proper steps to be taken by the Contractor when abortive work is foreseen? Please also include the involvement of other parties under the Contract in the process from the start to the completion of assessment of the claims related to abortive work.

Please advise the Project Manager by a memo.

[14 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Contractor's entitlement to claim abortive work
	- Strangely, SFBC do not contain the term abortive work. Abortive work means something done or purchased has to be changed including demolition and therefore become abortive. 
	- Abortive work on site can be caused by many different reasons such as late instruction for design changes after the Contractor has procured the materials or carried out due to variations before ordering materials, the Contractor's own fault in deign for which he is responsible and in materials and workmanship, etc.  Damage caused by natural events such as rain, storm, fire, etc can also result in abortive work
		- Certainly, the Contractor is not entitled to recover additional cost in carrying out abortive work due to his own fault or due to persons or events for which he is responsible under Contract
		- If the abortive work is caused by Employer's fault or persons or events for which he is responsible under Contract, the Contractor can get compensation
		- If the change leading to abortive work is due to instructed variations, the abortive work should be treated as apart of variation. If the change is caused by damage by the persons or events for which the Employer is responsible, Contractor can require the rectification work to be instructed as a variation
		- An instruction variation addition would entitle Contractor to additional payment as variation under cl.13.3(a), EOT for critical delay under cl.25.1(3)(h) and related monetary compensation under cl.27.1(2)(c). Monetary compensation can include profit under SFBC.
		- Bonus: late clarification of ambiguity, discrepancy or divergence between the Contract Doc and post contract instructions and supplementary information can result in abortive work. This would be treated as a variation
		- Bonus: opening up for inspection of work covered up or testing can result in abortive work. The consequence will depend on who should be liable. There is a specific contract clause to deal with this, and the abortive work is not usually so called.
		- Bonus: apart from treating abortive work as part of variations, SFBC also have clauses to permit EOT, L&E for events which may cause abortive work, e.g. force majeure, inclement weather, trophical cyclone, black rainstorm, excepted risks, specified perils, etc.
- Procedures
	- While there can be many valid grounds to claim abortive work, the most important step is to keep records of abortive work before making changes
	- Upon receipt of a variation instruction from Architect or the happening of other entitling events likely to result in abortive work, Contractor should immediately check and report if any abortive work will be incurred due to variation or event, so that Architect can, if possible, revise the design or take other actions to avoid abortive work.
	- If the variation is confirmed by Architect to proceed in spite of abortive work or abortive work has already been caused by some other events which cannot be controlled in advance, a joint site inspection should be conducted with Architect or COW as soon as practicable to record the status of work carried out or completed.
	- The joint site inspection records should state clearly the respective variation instruction number or the description of other entitling events, the date of the inspection, location, description, and extent of affect work completed and work which may become abortive, the description and quantities of abortive materials, if any. Photos and measurement should be taken. Videos may also be taken. The records must be endorsed by Architect or COW and Contractor immediately for proper records
	- While the site inspection records should serve as a true record, it does not necessarily mean that the abortive work is valid for payment. The validity of the abortive work should be checked and confirmed with Architect before inclusion in valuation for payment and final account.
	- Abortive work may often require demolition and alterations. If the nature of the demolition and alterations is such that the work cannot properly be measured and valued, then valuation on daywork basis should be adopted, but his would require the Architect's prior consent, and with record of labour, materials, and plant spent on the abortive work properly recorded and verified by Architect before inclusion in the valuation for payment and final account under cl.13.4(2)
	- Abortive materials once paid by Employer will become property of the Employer, and shall therefore be identified and stored separately as directed by Architect. If Contractor is authorized to sell abortive materials, the sales value after deducting Contractor's handling charges should be deducted from future payments and final account
	- If Contractor wants to claim EOT or L&E due to abortive work, he should follow the procedures laid down in Contract to give notices and claims substantiations for Architect and QS to precess all as stated in cl.25, 27, 28.
	- Bonus: prior consent to use daywork and verification of daywork records are required by SFBC. In the absence of prior consent or verification, building up of unit rates with the first principle using genuine time records should also be acceptable.

## Question

Question No. 2 – Expiry of Tender Validity

[This question shall be based on the project information given in Question No. 1]

Option A in Question No. 1 was chosen by the Client. Tenders for the Works based on an unamended standard form of contract were submitted 6 months ago. The award of the Contract has been postponed as site possession cannot be given due to some delays in obtaining statutory approval. The preferred tenderer, having agreed to extend his tender validity from 3 months to 6 months, said that he cannot extend the tender validity any further without changing his tender price. The Client expects the approval can be obtained no earlier than 2 months from now with the worst case being 6 months but no guarantee is given. Apart from negotiating a price increase amount or mechanism with the preferred tenderer, the Client is considering two scenarios:

Scenario 1 – Award the contract now and deal with the matter according to the terms and conditions of the Contract; or

Scenario 2 – Do not award the contract and terminate the tendering. Retender when the statutory approval is obtained.

You are requested to advise the Client by a letter on the implications of each scenario for further discussion. Quote the relevant contract clauses in case of Scenario 1. Give the relative order of seriousness of the implications on the times and the construction costs between the two scenarios. No absolute amounts of costs are required.

You are not required to suggest mitigation measures for or better alternatives to the scenarios to complicate the discussions.

## Assessor Notes

- Scenario 1: award then solve in post contract
	- In a nutshell, contract awarded with site possession subsequently delayed would lead to:
		- EOT, L&E
		- Determination if the delay is more serious than specified
		- Relationship turning sour from day one if financial compensation not settled
	- SFBC clauses area
		- Cl.23.1(1)
		- Cl.25.3(j)(i)
		- Cl.27.1(2)(e)(k)
		- Cl. 36.1(1)(d)
	- Bonus: it is possible under SFBC that the start date of the contract period is earlier or later than the site possession date. In the former case, there should be a specified or reasonable time gap between the contract award date and the site possession date. A delay to the site possession date beyond the time gap should be critical. In the later case, the delay to the site possession date may or may not be critical depending on the work possibly carried out before the start of the contract period. A delay beyond the original start date of the contract period should be critical
	- Bonus: while the period of EOT may be easy to determine, it may not be easy and ready enough to ascertain and agree with Contractor the financial compensation or damages resulted from suspension, prolongation and inflation. The relationship between Employer and Contractor may turn sour from the very beginning of the Contract, and this would be detrimental to the smooth running of the Contract.
- Scenario 2: retender later
	- Bonus: usually no compensation needs to be made to the present tenderers if the tendering is terminated
	- Engagement of the Contractor and the construction of the works will be delayed much longer than Scenario 1 with consequential loss to client's future income.
	- Client will have to bear the risks of tender price fluctuation
	- Preferred tenderer may no longer be competitive in the retender
	- Client will have to bear the costs of retender including but not limited to consultancy fees, administration costs, etc.
	- Bonus: however, on the positive side, the preferred tenderer my just be the best one out of the existing tenderers. Additional tenderers and perhaps better tenderers may be invited to the retendering
	- Also, the time delayed can be taken to supplement or correct any inadequacies in the original design and tender documents, and to catchup with any new market trends.
- Comparison between the two
	- Time
		- For the time implication of Scenario 1, the estimated delay will be at least 2 months up to 6 months or even more with no guarantee. The delay may be mitigated if the Contractor takes the time pending statutory approval to carry out such preliminary work as planning, engineering, statutory submission, procurement of plant and materials
		- Scenario 2 will need extra time of 2-3 months for inviting tenders, tendering, tender analysis, and award over the delay under Scenario 1 if, as the question says, "retender when the statutory approval is obtained"
		- If determination occurs, the delay will be much more serious than the extra 2-3 months required by Scenario 2. The full impact will depend on the time of determination and the subsequent actions by both parties.
	- Cost
		- For the cost implications in case of no determination, both Scenario 1 & 2 should in theory by subject to the same inflationary increase for the period until the site possession date, but Scenario 2 should have more due to the longer delay. However, if the market price is decreasing or the tenderers become more competitive, there can be a chance of lowered prices in case of Scenario 2.
		- Scenario 1 will attract prolongation and disruptive costs if some work is carried out before site possession. Contractor may not be able to control his subcon or supplier's prices in case of Scenario 1 to be in line with the general inflationary increase. The handling of the cost claims will be difficult. The cost implication of Scenario 1 are less predictable.
		- In case of determination under Scenario 1, the financial compensation to the Contractor can be a huge amount covering at least the loss of profits which may be earned from this Contract.
		- Bonus: consultants will incur additional costs due to abnormal nature of the delayed site possession, the contractual administration complications so induced in Scenario 1, the extra services required for retendering in Scenario 2, and the longer service period in both scenarios. Additional fees would be required depending on the terms of the consultancy appointment.
		- Bonus: in view of the uncertainty of the financial implications and compensation which may be made, and the sour working relationship so created, Scenario 1 is worse than Scenario 2.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Engagement of Consultants

You are the in-house Quantity Surveying Manager of a property development company. Your company currently owns a portfolio of shopping centres (around 20 nos.) and is scheduled to carry out a rebranding exercise affecting the shopping centres. The rebranding exercise will be in phases to be completed within three years.

The Project Manager of your company has suggested the following three methods of engaging design professionals to provide design consultancy services:

Option 1: award to a single lead consultant capable of delivering all the required design services with sub-consultants to be engaged by the lead consultant. Option 2: break down the required services according to major disciplines (e.g., architectural, structural, building services, etc.) and award separately. Option 3: similar to Option 1, but on a framework basis with a number of lead consultants invited to tender at the same time and shortlisted with prices fixed to provide services when required as a standing offer. The contract for each shopping centre can be awarded separately and progressively using predetermined objective criteria such as their current workloads, their current performance, etc. To be scored upon selection for award.

Admiring your expertise in procurement of construction contracts, the Project Manager would like to seek your views on:

(a) the advantages and disadvantages of Options 1 and 2; and  
(b) how would Option 3 compare with the advantages and disadvantages of Option 1 following the same item references of the advantages and disadvantages you identified under (a) above, with suggestions for improvement if no better.

Please advise your Project Manager with a memo.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A single lead consultant and its team
	- Advantages
		- Tendering once only. Relatively simple to procure as compared to many consultancy contracts
		- A single point of responsibilities by and contact with the lead consultant
		- Relatively simple for the commissioning and coordination of services amongst various disciplines
		- Consistency of design adopted for the re-branding
		- Likely to generate significant market interest amongst major consultants due to the high volume and predictability of business
		- Potential for efficiencies through economies of scale
		- Bonus: retention of knowledge and learning within a single consultant leading to potential productivity increases
		- Bonus: ability to develop strategic relationships with the lead consultant
	- Disadvantages
		- Reliant on a single consultant can increase risks in event of any failure of this consultant or its sub-consultants
		- Less certainty of the quality of sub-consultants
		- No ongoing competition as only one lead consultant is appointed
		- The response time when handling 20 nos shopping centres all at about the same time will be longer
		- Peak workload may exceed the capacity of the lead consultant and its team
		- Bonus: risk of being stuck with the lead consultants with limited access to other consultants for their expertise, new technologies, alternative approaches and innovations
- Separately engaged consultants for different disciplines
	- Advantages
		- Ability to procure "the best in clause" consultant for each discipline. The quality is more certain.
		- Many attract smaller specialist consultants to submit tenders
		- Separate consultants may generate more new ideas
	- Disadvantages
		- Tendering many times. More time consuming to procure as compared to a single lead consultant
		- No single point of responsibilities by and contact with so many consultants
		- More complex to administer and coordinate the delivery of services due to larger number of the interfaces
		- Bigger consultants may not be interested if the total volume of business is reduced
- Many lead consultants and their teams standing by
	- Comparison with advantages of Option 1
		- Similar advantage, still with one set of tender documents, but more effort to prepare the framework arrangement, standing offers and greater number of contracts
		- Similar advantage, but more than one lead consultant
		- Similar advantage in terms of commissioning and coordination amongst different disciplines, but more complex to administer and coordinate the greater number of contracts
		- More effort required to ensure consistency of design. More coordination by the Client would be required to pass on the accepted standards across different contracts 
		- Bigger consultants may not be interested because of the possible reduction in the total volume of business
		- Potential for higher fees due to loss of economies of scale when only one contract is awarded at a time
	- Comparison with disadvantages of Option 1
		- Less reliant on single consultant. Greater chances to appoint the best team for each contract based on the contemporary conditions
		- Less certainty on quality of sub-consultants
		- Better chances of consultant team performing better in expectation of being selected for the next contract within the framework.
		- Quicker response time with shared workload
		- Less likely to exceed the capacity
		- Bonus: access to a greater number of consultants for their expertise, new technologies, alternative approaches and innovation. Offering opportunities for ongoing benchmarking and competition between consultants for future projects.
	- Suggestions for improvement
		- Reduce the number of contracts to be awarded - on location or value basis 
		- Stipulate discount to be applied if a greater number of contracts is awarded for services rendered for about the same time
		- Set out a realistic and deliverable programme of future workload to provide confidence and visibility to the tendering consultants
		- Make the criteria for awarding contracts under the framework simple and transparent

## Question

Question No. 1 – Long Lead Items and MiC

You are the consultant QS for a building contract for the construction of three blocks of hostels comprising 2,238 nos. Of concrete Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) room modules.

The contract is scheduled for tender invitation in February 2022 and award in June 2022 with a permissible construction period of 18 months to meet the target occupation date. The long lead time of the (much desired based on past experience) Integrated Air Handling Unit modules (I−AHU)∧ manufactured in Germany (12-month manufacture and delivery to the MiC factory after award) and MiC modules (6-month production in Guangdong) will cause the overall construction period to exceed 18 months. It is the Client’s intention to enter into a direct contract with the I-AHU supplier so that the supplier can proceed prior to the award of the building contract.

You are required to advise the Employer on the following:

(a) What would be the implications if the I-AHU supply contract is novated to the building contractor upon the award of the building contract? If the supply contract terms and the pro-forma novation agreement are fully included in the tender documents for the building contract, suggest 2 possible cases for the building contractor to refuse when tendering, and 2 possible cases to refuse novation after his appointment? What would be the consequences if the building tenderer/contractor’s refusal is justified?

(b) The suitability of adopting a Nominated Sub-Contract vs a domestic subcontract for the design, supply and installation of MiC modules.

^ MiC is a construction method whereby freestanding volumetric modules with finishes, fixtures, fittings, furniture and building services installation, etc. Are manufactured off-site and then transported to site for installation.

^ I-AHU includes components: AHU, local motor control panel, direct digital control panel and chilled water valve set, piping and wiring connection.

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Novation
	- A novation agreement has to be signed by the original contract parties, the Client and the supplier, and by the building contractor, whereby all the rights and obligations of the Client will be transferred to the building contractor with no further concerns. The supplier and the building contractor will continue to fulfill the terms of the supply contract as if they were the original contract parties except as modified by the novation agreement. The building contractor will have to take up the risks of the performance of the supplier.
	- If the supply contract terms and the pro-forma novation agreement are fully included in the tender documents for the building contract, the chances for the building contractor to refuse novation will be reduced. However, the building tenderer will have to consider whether he can accept the transferred obligations and risks, and state his non-acceptance when submitting his tender, e.g.:
		- Inconsistencies between the terms included in the supply contract (i.e. not- back-to-back approach enough to cover his risks)
		- The supplier is technically or financially incapable  to deliver 
		- The supplier is already known to be late
		- The supplier and the tenderer have poor relationship before
	- After his own appointment, the building contractor may refuse novation if the situations at the time of novation are different from those described in the tender documents or accepted tender, e.g.:
		- The supplier is already late
		- The quality of the products of the supplier is found to be not consistent with the requirements of the building contract
		- The Client has not duly paid the supplier
		- The updated supply contract sum is more than that upon which the building contract sum is based
	- The Client will have to exempt the building contractor from such known and valid complaints, agree adjustment to the building contract sum or contract period, include terms to deal with similar future happenings, etc., all under the building contract, in order to get the building contractor to sign the novation agreement. Otherwise, the novation will fail and the Client will have to continue with the supply contract with the supplier, deal with the supplier's problems directly, and deal with the adverse implications upon the building contract according to the building contract.
- NSC v DSC for D&B MiC
	- NSC
		- Pro
			- The Employer may enter into temporarily binding contractual relationship with a specialist subcon manufacturing MiC before Contractor is appointed. This subcon will subsequently become the NSC although in some instances the MC has the right to raise reasonable objections.
			- Early engage of the specialist subcon for early design input and manufacture before the appointment of the MC will be made possible
			- MC will not need to spend effort to invite tenders, select and then provide for a long lead period for the design and manufacture of MiC.
			- The selection of an appropriate NSC with whom Architect / Employer has confidence will offer the ability for the Architect to obtain and integrate design and coordination information, and greater control in respect of quality for an early commencement of the works.
		- Con
			- On the other hand, the Architect will take up the responsibility to set out the full details of NSC's works and coordinate and integrate with the design of the works not covered by the NSC.
			- MC is deprived of his input at the design and manufacturing stage of the MiC modules. His input in logistics and buildability will be much reduced
			- MC may not be prefer NSC selected by Architect. That may cause more coordination issued.
			- MC is entitled to claim EOT and L&E in the vent of delay or default caused by specialist subcon nominated by Architect despite the MC's valid objection
	- DSC
		- As the specialist subcon is selected by MC, there would be no chance for objection to nomination. The specialist subcon may as well be MC's in-house department
		- Early engagement of the specialist subcon for early design input and manufacture before the appointment of Contractor is not possible
		- MC will have to invite tenders, select and then provide for a long lead period for the design and manufacture of MiC in his master programme
		- Submission and integration of MiC design with the rest of the building works will have to be done after the appointment of MC
		- Any coordination issues with the specialist subcon will have to be resolved and absorbed by MC, with no time or cost claim entertained for delay or default caused by specialist subcon
		- Involvement of MC in the design and manufacture stage should enhance the design and buildability 
		- There will be little control by the Employer on the selection of the specialist subcon
		- The 18-month construction period may become tight with no early start of design and manufacture of MiC before MC is appointed
		- Tender price of MiC could be more competitive with MC's proposed subcon or in-house department
		- To get the benefits of early design and manufacture, MC himself should be appointed early as well

## Question

Question No. 2 – Valuation of M&E Variations

You are the QS of Mars, the domestic sub-contractor for the M&E Works (MVAC and electrical) for an indoor sports centre refurbishment project. The Sub-Contract is a lump sum contract based on drawings and specification without bills of quantities but with SOR prepared by your company according to the common M&E practice and not necessarily following the HKSMM4. An Architect’s Instruction has recently been issued making substantial revisions to the M&E Works. Unfortunately, the person who prepared the SOR has left your company, and your QS team consists mainly of fresh QS graduates. In order for them to carry out the valuation of the variations properly with good chance of acceptance by the Main Contractor, your Director has asked you to write a memo to set out some guidelines with reasons in the following respects for them to follow:

(a) Should the measurement be based on the instruction drawings, or shop/installation drawings, or as-built drawings, or site measurement?  
(b) Which method of measurement should be used?  
(c) Apart from those measured from the drawings, what are the items which may be added?  
(d) Can complete remeasurement be adopted?

Please write.

[13 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Drawing basis
	- Measurement should be based on the tender drawings and the instruction drawings as that they are common basis in terms of the levels of details
	- Shop / installation dwg are prepared by the subcon based on the tender dwg and instruction dwg for installation purpose and may contain more location information as compared to those dwg, or different routing to suit the site conditions at the discretion or risks of the subcon, but not measurable according to the method of measurement applicable to the Sub-Contract, and therefore cannot be used as the basis of measurement
	- However, the tender dwg and instruction dwg may not be sufficient enough to show the lengths of ducts, pipes, conduits and wiring to enable accurate measurement. In such cases, the shop / installation dwg may need to be referred to for supplement, but the same interpretation should be adopted for measuring omissions and additions
	- As-built dwg reflect the actual as-built conditions which may have deviations from the tender dwg / instruction dwg/ shop dwg, and should therefore not be used for measurement except when it is necessary to supplement the inadequacy of those drawings, but unauthorized work is to be excluded
	- Similar to the as-built drawings, site measurement should also not be adopted. Furthermore, because it can only enable measurement of the ad-built situation and may not enable measurement of the original situation before change. It should only be adopted when mutually agreed or for daywork or for abortive work.
- Method of measurement
	- Same method of measurement stated in Sub-Contract should be used.
	- However, when a SOR is prepared by Sub-Contractor, the Sub-Contract usually specifies that any missing measurement shall be deemed to have been included for in other rates and prices and cannot be measured separately anymore (if the proportion of the work missing original measurement has been significantly changed due to variations, this may be a subject for special claim)
	- With or without express method of measurement, the Sub-Contract may also state that the work shall be measured net as fixed in place
	- Subject to the foregoing, the same method of measurement used when measuring SOR should be used. This method may need to be inferred from the SOR
- Item to be added apart from dwg
	- Items which are described in the specification and measurable according to method of measurement applicable to the Sub-Contract
	- Abortive work and ordering due to the variations
	- Site overhead for design coordination, shop drawing submission, testing, prelim items, etc due to special and significant changes (Sub-Contractor can price for them separately in the prelim or in the measured works section by inserting items in SOR or allow for the costs in the unit rates. The lump sums are generally regarded as allowances not to be adjusted. If the costs are included in the unit rates, they are not to be measured separately. However, in case of excessive omissions resulting in the costs included in the unit rates for the balance of the works not adequate to cover the costs, the loss should be included in the valuation. If there are special and significant increase of the services due to variations, the extra costs should also be included in the valuation)
	- Other direct loss and expense due to variations
- Whether complete remeasurement
	- If the complete measurement is meant to use the total value of the such remeasured qty to replace the original Sub-Contract value, then this is not acceptable. This is because there may be under or over measurements in the original Sub-Contract value, which shall be deemed to have been accepted by both parties and shall not be corrected. Such remeasurement will mean the lump sum contract will effectively be changed to a remeasurement contract, and the under or over measurements will take no effect anymore.
	- If the complete measurement is done twice, once based on the tender drawings and once based on the mutually agreed set of instruction drawings or other drawings, both based on the same method of measurement used in preparing the SOR, and if the cost effects are presented in the form of {original sub-contract sum - value of remeasurement of tender drawings + value of final remeasurement}, then it is acceptable because the adjustment is only for the net cost effect of the variations without disturbing the under or over measurements in SOR

## Question

Question No. 3 – Omission of Works

You are the Project QS of a contractor. Your project is divided into two Sections, namely Section 1 and Section 2. Section 1 is for the construction of a four-storey high Administration Building. Section 2 is for levelling and forming a 50m×50m landscaped plaza adjacent to the Administration Building. According to the master programme submitted by the Contractor, Section 2 shall commence after 70% of Section 1 works are completed.

Now, Section 1 is 50% completed but with a delay of 3 months. Section 2 has not commenced yet.

Yesterday, you received a letter from the Architect instructing that the whole of Section 2 is to be omitted from the Contract as a variation. The letter provides three reasons for the omission:

- Progress of Section 1 works has been delayed by 3 months  
- Honeycomb defects repeatedly appear from G/F to 3/F of the in-situ concrete structure  
- Number of workforce recorded on Site is 20% less than that shown on submitted resource plan.

You have checked that all the issues stated with the above reasons are true. During a telephone conversation with the Architect, your Project Director understood that the Employer intends to have the omitted works carried out by another contractor by way of re-tender. The Project Director is very concerned about the loss of profit with the omission of Section 2 and therefore would like to keep Section 2 works in the Contract by all possible means. He will have an urgent meeting with the Employer and the Architect tomorrow and has asked you to give him an internal memo to explain the contractual positions in respect of each of the above issues and the omission, with some suggestions to convince the Architect to withdraw the omission instruction.

## Assessor Notes

- Slow progress of work
	- If A considers that the progress is to slow to ensure that the works can be completed by the Completion Date due to the default of MC, he may pursuant to clause 25.5(1) notify MC accordingly
	- According to clause 25.5(2), MC may then at its own discretion take measures to expedite the work progress at his own expense
	- Irrespective of whether MC selects to expedite or not, if the works cannot be completed by Completion Date eventually and the Architect issues a certificate to that effect, Employer is entitled to deduct LAD under cl.24.1(1) and 24.2(1)
	- Suggestion
		- Suggestions to expedite the progress should be given without waiting for the instructions, e.g. re-sequence of work from sequential to parallel, arrange overtime work, deploy more labour on site, start Section 2 works earlier to keep the original Completion Date
		- If Section 2 on time completion is really required by Employer for some special purpose, convince Employer and Architect that the employment of others to carry out Section 2 works would not be earlier than if the Contractor starts Section 2 works now.
- Poor quality of work
	- Under cl.8.1, MC must provide materials, goods, workmanship and work of the types, standards and quality described in the contract
	- If MC fails to do so, A may instruct MC to remove the non-compliant materials, goods, workmanship or work from the Site pursuant to clause 8.3(a) or repair / demolish / remove / re-construct the non-compliant work pursuant to clause 8.3(b), 8.4 and 17.3(1) at ay time until the end of the DLP, all without conferring on MC a right to additional payment
	- Suggestion
		- Rectify the defects and improve the forthcoming work should be given without waiting for the instruction, e.g. enhance quality control measure, strengthen process management, set up site quality inspection team
- Insufficient workforce on site
	- MC does not have express provision to deal with smaller workforce than planned. See the above if slow progress or poor quality is resulted
	- Suggestion
		- There can be many reasons for the smaller workforce. MC should reasonably put forward
		- Increase the workforce to suit the programme
- Omission of works
	- None of the above issues would confer a right on Architect to omit a substantial part of the works as a VO. Therefore, it may be argued that A's reliance on the 3 issues as reasons to omit is without proper basis.
	- Clause 13.1(1)(b) requires MC's written consent to an instruction omitting work in order for it to be carried out by others. Therefore, A has no right to omit Section 2.
	- In the absence of this express term, under the common law, if the Employer omits work in order for it to be carried out by others, he shall be liable for the loss and expense caused to MC including loss of profit.
	- For valid omission of work, MC is entitled to compensation of expense which has become wholly or partly unnecessary as a result of the omission under cl.13.4(3)(b), and adjustment to the unit rates for the remaining work if the omission substantially changes the conditions under which the remaining work is carried out, and results in the rates for the remaining work becoming unreasonable or inapplicable (cl.13.4(6))
	- Suggestion
		- Raise circumstances where unnecessary expenses may be incurred or the unit rates for the remaining work may be rendered unreasonable and inapplicable, e.g. Section 2's site are is being or will be used as temporary storage area or other site logistics purpose; the supplier and subcon for Section 2 have been committed

## Question

Question No. 4 – BQ Errors

You are the consultant QS for a residential project in construction stage anticipated to be completed next month. The Contract is a traditional lump sum contract with quantities. The Contractor issued a letter to your office yesterday, titled “Bills of Quantities Errors”, listing out items which he claimed as errors found in the Bills of Quantities (BQ), and requesting your office to follow up and assess accordingly.

After review, your assistant QS has come up with the following list of items with some factual information. You are now required to advise on the contractual positions and the follow-up actions:

(a) The actual quantities of gully traps constructed on Site exceed the firm quantities measured in the BQ.  

(b) The quantity of Timber Door type 1 shown on the timber door schedule is different from that shown on the layout plans, while both schedule and layout plans form part of the Contract Drawings. 

(c) Nil amount has been assessed or paid for expansion joints to underground drain pipes which have been included in the BQ as provisional quantities but not found on any Contract Drawings.  

(d) No quantity has been measured for top formwork to in-situ reinforced concrete slab sloping at 10 degrees from the horizontal while the formwork to the soffit of that sloping slab has been billed under “soffit of slab” in the BQ.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Actual qty done exceeding BQ qty
	- Check the correctness of BQ qty against Contract Dwg and the correctness of the actual qty against instruction dwg to find out the reasons for the differences
	- VO authorized by AI should be measured, valued and paid for under cl.13.3 & 13.5
	- BQ error should be deemed to be valid VO for sole purpose of adjusting contract sum under cl.14.3(2)
	- Work done without authorization should not be paid for under cl.13.1(3)
	- Confirmatory instructions should be issued for work done as orally instructed under 4.2(1) - though there is a risk of being declared too late
- Discrepancies between Contract Drawings
	- Since there is a discrepancy between Contract Drawings, MC should request A to clarify whether the schedule or the plan or some other new information should be followed by way of AI under cl.2.4
	- If quantity accordingly confirmed is different from BQ qty, this should be treated as VO, part of which may be due to BQ errors depending on whether new information has been used or not
- No payment for Pro Qty not shown on Contract Drawings
	- Pro qty can be included in BQ for potential work not shown on Contract Drawings
	- AI is required for the carrying out of work covered by pro qty (cl.13.2). Therefore, no payment can be made due to no instruction. If work has actually been done, MC should ask A to issue AI to authorize, and valuation for the remeasurement of the pro qty can be made for payment purposes under cl.13.3(b)
- Top formwork to sloping slab
	- According to HKSMM4 Section VII Concrete Works item (d) measurement rule M.10, top formwork is only measured for surfaces sloping exceeding 15 degrees, no matter whether it is provided or not. Hence, no top formwork shall be measured for the sloping RC slab sloping 10 degrees only.
	- According to HKSMM4 Section VII Concrete Works item (d)2.1.2 under the classification table, formwork to sloping soffit of slab shall be measured separately in BQ, and there is a BQ error.
	- BQ errors should be deemed to be valid VO under cl.14.3(2)

Question No. 1 – Cost Estimates

You are an in-house QS Manager of Spot Light Investment Ltd. Who is developing a residential tower – Project K. Yesterday, you finished a ballpark estimate of the construction cost on $/m2 basis by benchmarking against another Spot Light’s project of very similar scale now under construction – Project E. Project K particulars are as follows:

As requested by your in-house Project Director, please prepare the following for discussion this afternoon:

(a) Write some notes to describe how to estimate and update progressively the costs of the concrete structure from the inception stage when there is no specific design up to the time before the tender drawings are fully prepared.  

(b) List and describe the work items to be considered when estimating the cost of addition of 1 No. Passenger lift to Project K to enhance vertical transportation when Project E has 3 no. Passenger lifts in one lift shaft serving all floors.  

(c) Give a build-up of the composite rate per m2 of 300 mm concrete lift shaft wall.  

(d) Estimate the cost of adding one floor for a communal sky garden on 10/F to obtain exemption from GFA calculation. The effect of item (b) can be ignored.

## Assessor Notes

- Estimate cost of concrete structure update
	- Estimate are prepared very roughly at the very early stage and are to be updated progressively with more accurate methods as the design is developed. The progressive steps are:-
	- Analyse the cost per floor area from past projects, apply tender price indices to adjust the price levels, multiply by the total floor area, and make percentage adjustments for other special factors like site location, building type and complexity, plan shape, storey and building heights, etc.
	- Analyse the quantity factors (e.g. m3 concrete per floor area, m2 formwork per floor area or m3 concrete, kg reinforcement per floor area or per m3 concrete, etc.) from past projects, multiply by the total floor area, apply updated unit rates, and make percentage adjustments for other special factors like site location, building type and complexity, plan shape, storey and building height, etc.
	- Bonus: enhance the accuracy on quantity by using the architectural layout plans with assumption on sizes of key structural members learned from past projects. Measure their approximate quantities and combine with the other members
	- Use the framing plan provided by the structural engineers, measure approximate quantities per floor area (of sampled area), multiply by the total floor area, apply steel ratios provided by the structural engineers, and apply updated unit rates
- List work items for addition of 1 no passenger lift
	- Addition of extended lift shaft walls and dividing walls
	- Addition of hoisting beam, separator beams if no dividing walls, lift pit, cat ladder, lift pit sides and bottom, excavation, pit drain, lift machine room finishes, roof slabs, machine bases
	- Addition of wall finishes to increased wall areas
	- Omission of floor slabs, ceiling finishes and floor finishes at enlarged lift shaft
	- Upgrading of finishes at enlarged lift lobbies
	- Addition of loading on structure and substructure
	- Addition of the lift inclusive of IFO
	- Addition of electrical supply to lift and lift landing call panels
	- Slight effect on fire services
	- No effect on plumbing
	- Assuming remaining floor layout not seriously affected

## Question

Question No. 2 – Contract Execution

You are a newly employed Contract Manager of a small developer – XYZ Development Ltd. The main contract (lump sum with firm BQ) for the construction of a commercial building was awarded a few months ago with letter of award signed by both parties. The Contractor has commenced the site works. The pre-contract process including the contract award was basically handled by XYZ’s inhouse project management team. The Contract Documents are being compiled for execution. The project manager would like to seek your advice on the following issues:

(a) What date should be put on the Articles of Agreement? What would be the contractual implication if the formal contract is signed a few months after commencement of the site works? Shall we backdate to an earlier date?  

(b) Shall we include the Instructions to Tenderer (also commonly called “Conditions of Tender” or “Conditions of Tendering”) in the Contract Documents? Whether yes or no, why?  

(c) A page of specification about the submission of warranty for major M&E plant and equipment upon completion of the works was omitted in the Contractor’s submission of his tender in hard copy. It has not been discovered until now. Having reviewed the record, that page was surely issued to the Contractor with his confirmation of receipt. Should we add that page back to the Contract Documents?

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Date of Articles of Agreement
	- The date to be put on the Articles of Agreement should be the date when both parties meet to sign on the formal contract. However, if the parties do not meet but sign on different days, then either the date of signing by the first party or the date of signing by the second party should be used. The date to be used is not of very great contractual significance because when the letter of award was signed, a binding contract was formed on "offer and acceptance" basis being the Contractor's offer based on Tender Documents and the tender correspondence accepted by Employer. The parties can then exercise their contractual rights and obligations whether or not the formal contract is signed. Backdating is therefore unnecessary. On the other hand, the date of signing may be of significance in other business outside the Contract. Therefore, backdating is not a good practice because it effectively states a date that is false and should be avoided.
	- Bonus: In the absence of an agreed consolidated set of Contract Documents, the contract administration may become cumbersome. That may cause confusion and even arguments over what should or should not be included in the Contract Documents. If there is argument between the parties developed before the Contract is signed, one party or both parties may refuse to sign the Contract until the argument is settled. Therefore, it is advisable to give a full list of the documents to be included in the Contract Documents and sign the Contract as soon as possible.
- Instructions to Tenderers
	- The Instructions to Tenderers are essentially rules governing the procedures during the tender and award stage. They are not supposed to govern the post contract management. They should not contain any contract terms and conditions. Under SFBC clause 5.1, the Instructions to Tenderer are not listed as one of the documents forming part of the Contract. However, it is a normal practice to include all the documents included in the Tender Documents in the Contract Documents to serve as a complete set of record of documents issued for tendering in case references have been made to them in the tender correspondence, but it does not mean that each such document will form part of the Contract (i.e., having contractual effects) 
	- However, some consultants do include provisions in or attachments (e.g. declarations or undertakings in relation to confidentiality, conflict of interest, integrity, track records, which should have been done elsewhere) to the Instructions of Tender to govern the procedures and conduct after the award of the Contract. In that case, the Instruction to Tenderers should form part of the Contract and should be included in the Contract Documents.
	- Bonus: the Instructions to Tenderer usually tell the tenderer what are issued to him, what the tenderer shall submit with his tender, how his tender will be assessed, rules regarding adjustment of arithmetical errors, discounts, etc.
- Missing page
	- Instruction to Tenderer usually require the tenderer to check the completeness of the Tender Documents against the contents page, and also specify that the tenderer is not allowed to make unauthorised alteration to the Tender Documents. As the question says, the Contractor has confirmed receipt of the Tender Documents. The Form of Tender usually requires the tenderer to declare that his tender is submitted with full examination of all Tender Documents. The Form of Tender also usually contains a statement that the tender is based on the Tender Documents. Therefore, that missing specification page is a clerical mistake in the Contractor's submission and shall be rectified by inclusion in the Contract Documents for execution. 
	- Bonus: Some tenderers chop every page of the returned Tender Documents. If the Contractor has done so, he should be required to chop the missing page as well for binding into the Contract Documents

## Question

Question No. 3 – Works Outside Site Boundary

You are a consultant QS for a project comprising low rise industrial buildings. Now at the tender preparation stage, the Architect has prepared the following draft tender drawings:

![Pasted image 20250413113226|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250413113226.png)

At the project meeting, the Architect has explained the above drawings and mentioned that the Works will include builder’s works for utility connections under public walkway which are to be conducted outside site boundary, as indicated as “Part B Works” on the Site Layout Plan.

The Architect has requested your advice on the following:

(a) Whether the site boundary shall be extended to cover the area where Part B Works are to be carried out.  

(b) Whether the Contractors’ All Risks Insurance shall include Part B Works provided that it is the Contractor’s responsibility to effect the insurance under the Contract.

(c) What, with brief description, key points shall be included in the Tender Documents including the pricing documents for execution of works of this nature outside site boundary.  

(d) What amendment(s) to the Drawing No. A2 are recommended for clarity.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Whether to extend site boundary
	- Although there is no defined term for site boundary, the Site is defined as "the land or other places provided by Employer for the purpose of carrying out of the Works" under SFBC clause 1
	- It is common practice for the Architect to show the location and extent of the Site with boundary line, delineating the site boundary
	- It is a contractual responsibility for the Employer to give possession of the Site to the Contractor on or before Date for Possession of the Site under SFBC clause 23.1
	- Part B works, i.e., the builder's works for utility connections, are part of works to be carried out by Contractor but fall outside the site boundary
	- If the site boundary is extended to include the area of Part B works, the Employer will be obliged to give possession of the area for Part B works to Contractor, which Employer cannot fulfill such contractual requirement since he does not possess the area which is outside the site boundary
	- If the Employer fails to give possession on the Date for Possession, the Employer is technically in breach of contract due to act of prevention, which will result in EOT, additional payment and even determination in worst case. Hence, it is not recommended to extend the site boundary to cover area where the Employer does not have possession.
- CAR for works outside the Site
	- Under the Contract, it is the Contractor's responsibility for the care of the whole works, except for loss or damage arising from Excepted Risks
	- The works to be carried out outside the site are also part of the works
	- Contractor who is obliged to effect and maintain CAR shall ensure the insurance policy covers the whole works, whether they are carried out within or outside the site
	- However, the insurance policy usually defined the site and the insured works as being those on the site. Therefore, it is important that suitable descriptions or endorsement be included to cover works outside the site
- Points to be included in the Tender Doc
	- Statements specifying clearly works outside site boundary, including their locations, extent and scope of works within the aid of drawings
	- Restrictions for carrying out works outside site boundary such as no exclusive possession, working hours, traffic diversion, safety measures, statutory permits required, party responsible for applying for permits, interfacing or coordination works with other parties, etc.
	- Requirements for reinstatement after the works are completed in that area
	- Reminder of insurance cover
	- Identification of the works to be carried out outside site boundary separately in BQ or SOR for pricing
- Amendment to Drawing No.A2
	- Part B works shall be excluded from area of possession of the site on Drawing No. A2 since no possession outside site boundary will be provided to the Contractor

#Procurement 
## Question

Question No. 4 – Change of Procurement Strategy

You are an in-house QS of a Developer and are responsible for the procurement of a 10-storey automated carpark (“the Project”).

The procurement approach is intended to be a design and build contract. The tender assessment is to be based on a combined technical and price evaluation. There are four shortlisted tenderers. Tender Documents have been prepared and are ready for tendering.

Before the issuance of the Tender Documents, an internal meeting was held amongst the senior management and the Project Director. During the meeting, the Chief Executive Officer made the following comment:

“Given that the automated parking system to be adopted is a new technology, in order to ensure the awarded contractor can take full cognizance of operability and maintainability in his design and be more conscious of his construction quality, should it be much better if the design, build, operate and maintenance approach be adopted instead of the design and build approach, so that the awarded contractor is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the carpark for a period of time after completion of the works?”

After the meeting, the Project Director reviewed the procurement strategy for the Project and would like you to advise him via a memo on the assumption that the same contractor will be responsible for the design, build, operate and maintenance of the Project:

(a) The advantages and disadvantages of the design, build, operate and maintenance approach compared with the design and build approach.  

(b) The additional tender assessment requirements and methods required on top of design and build.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Advantages compared with D&B
	- Integration of and synergies 协同效应 between design, construction operation and maintenance can widen the scope of and freedom for innovation and optimization at different stages with lower costs, better buildability and better performance because longer term costs and benefits can be considered
	- Appointment of a single contractor provides unity of responsibility. The Contractor is solely responsible for all stages of the project delivery and the subsequent operation and maintenance of the completed project
	- With a clear specification and requirements, the Employer is mainly responsible for financing the project only, with a hands off role. Employer can reduce or re-deploy his operation and maintenance resources
	- Longer term relationship between the Employer and the Contractor can be established
	- Certainty of cost of constructing, operating and maintaining the project at the award of contract can be increased with lower risk of cost overruns and no financial claims due to interfaces between different stages
	- The long term whole-life focus of this approach is likely to allow for a more robust allocation of risks to and by Contractor
	- Knowledge of operating and maintaining the facility can be transferred from Contractor to Employer at the end of the contract
- Disadvantages compared with D&B
	- The whole Tender Documents will need to be revised to include the additional scope and different trade practice for operation and maintenance. Different disciplines of consultants will need to be engaged
	- The tendering period will be prolonged due to the inclusion of operation and maintenance requirements, which can otherwise be done during the construction stage in the case of design and build
	- The shortlisted four tenderers may not all be willing and able to tender for the extended scope. More tenderers will need to be invited
	- There will be price premium for the single point responsibility in the arrangement or have the required capacity
	- There will be price premium because Contractor will have to allow for the risks for a longer term. The risks of constructing a building, operating and maintaining the building, operating and maintaining the automated carparking systems, carparking revenue, etc are very much different
	- At any stage, the flexibility to introduce operational or technical changes to the project in response to the market needs will be reduced
	- At any stage, it will be more difficult to value the cost implications of changes to the contract requirements because the contract sum should take into account the operating revenues, and any changes to the contract requirements will also need to take and effect on the revenues into account
	- It will be difficult for Employer to explore other uses of the building co-existing with or replacing the carparking business
	- If the Employer is also operating other carparks, the image and performance of this project may not align with those other carpark
	- Contractor will have much less incentive to operate and maintain properly if he has already got the design and construction prices paid leaving much smaller amount for the operation and maintenance services. Operating revenues from carparking, advertisement, other co-existing services will need to be taken into account in the contract sum. The contract sum is unlikely to be a fixed sum but will be based on a number of cost and revenue variables
	- Terminating the services of Contractor and the subsequent accounting will be more difficult than terminating the services of design and build contractor.
- Additional tender assessment requirements and methods on top of D&B
	- Whether the tenderer processes the expertise  in handling operation and maintenance 
	- The tenderer's proposed operation and maintenance management plan
	- Any innovative suggestions by the tenderer which are effective and practicable in improving the delivery of the operation and maintenance services
	- Whether the tenderer will sub-let all the operation and maintenance services to a third party as it may have adverse impacts on the quality
	- Overall technical assessment considering the respective scores on design, construction, operation and maintenance, each with a pre-determined passing score. Failure to pass certain criteria may lead to disqualification
	- Reasonableness of the price allocation to the D&B services against the operation and maintenance services to prevent an unrealistic front loading by Contractor to the D&B stage
	- Reasonableness of the maintenance cost proposed by tenderer. High maintenance costs may mean poorer system, but may also mean less front-loading
	- Whether and how the operation revenues will be accounted for in the contract sum
	- Present value after discounted cash flow analysis
	- Whether the tenderer possesses any statutory certificates in connection with operation and maintenance, including building management and security

## Question

Question No. 1 – Design Conflict

You are a Senior QS of a contractor overseeing a number of building (lump sum with quantities) projects. During an internal meeting in the head office, your site QS reported the following issues in his project that he considered to have been unfairly treated by the Architect.

Issues: - 

After agreeing to the Contractor’s suggested method to resolve a design conflict in the Architect’s designed underground drainage system (the proper functioning of which is one of the prerequisites for obtaining the Occupation Permit from the Buildings Department), the Architect declined to issue an instruction to cover the same or certify the respective payment, alleging that:

(a) the Architect has a discretion to issue or not to issue an instruction involving Variation under the Contract;  

(b) it was the Contractor’s own proposal and the acceptance of which should not have time and cost implications to the Contract;  

(c) it was the Contractor’s responsibility to inform the Architect any discrepancy in the documents forming part of the Contract with all reasonable skill, care and diligence; and  

(d) it was the Contractor’s responsibility to comply with all statutory requirements and all the associated time and cost are deemed to have been allowed for in the master programme and the Contract Sum respectively.

As a direct supervisor of the site QS, you feel obligated to explain to your subordinate and also other QSs in your company the correct contract positions in relation to the above issues. Please present your ideas in an internal memo.

[14 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Architect's discretion to issue or not issue AI 
	- Contractor is obliged to carry out the Works in accordance with the Contract Drawings and Specification under cl.2.1(1)
	- Contract Drawings and Specification are prepared by or under the discretion of or at the request of the Architect under Articles of Agreement 
	- Architect has the obligation to provide further drawings and specification necessary for the execution of the works under clause 5.6(1)
	- Contractor has no right to carry out work involving a Variation without a written instruction from the Architect or confirmation of an oral instruction from the Contractor except in the event of emergency under clause 13.1(3)
	- By definition, a Variation includes a change instructed by Architect to the design, quality or quantity of the works. He may or may not change but if he requires a change, he must instruct. There is no discretion. (cl.1.6)
	- If Architect's design does not work due to design conflict, the Architect must change the design to make it work and this requires a Variation with instruction
- Contractor's own proposal
	- It is usual for the Contract Bills or Specification to supplement that a Contractor's proposal to change the design, quality or quantity of the works shall be approved by the Architect and shall be deemed to have no cost or time effect.
	- If there is no such provision, the Contractor is not allowed to change. Any such change shall be regarded as a non-conformance. If the Architect subsequently accepts such non-conformance, there will be no cost or time effect.
	- Bonus: Contractors usually carry out oral instructions without waiting for formal written instructions. They do so at their peril. They should have waited till the issue of the formal written instructions.
	- Bonus: SFBC have the mechanism for the confirmation by Contractor of oral instructions by Architect but Contractor is not obliged to do so.
	- Usually the Contractor's proposal is to improve buildability or resolve problems in sourcing materials. If the Contractor intends that his proposal should have cost or time effect, he must state so when submitting the proposal.
	- Contractor when suggesting changes to the Architect's design must be very careful to ensure that his suggestion will not be interpreted as a Contractor's proposal.
	- Bonus: Uncertainty usually arises when the design or design development is to be undertaken by the Contractor, and the Architect makes changes during the shop drawings commenting process. Whether a comment constitutes a Variation must be clarified before the materials are ordered in accordance with the shop drawings,
	- In the present case, the design was provided by Architect. It should be demonstrated that the suggestion was to resolve a conflict in the Architect's design. If the process has not been well documented, the fact of a design conflict should still be easily proved.
- Contractor's responsibility to inform any discrepancy in the Contract Doc
	- Contractor shall inform the Architect (only) if he finds any ambiguity or discrepancy in or divergence between the documents forming part of the Contract and further documents issued by Architect during the carrying out of the works. If Architect agrees with the Contractor, he shall issue an instruction to resolve. If the resolution requires Variation, the instruction shall so required (cl.2.4)
	- The resolution of the present design conflict is an instruction requiring Variation
- Contractor's responsibility to comply with statutory requirements
	- Contractor is obliged to comply with statutory requirements under clause 6.1.
	- However, this obligation is founded on the premise that the Architect's design of the works is in compliance with the statutory requirements. If it does not, Architect shall issue an instruction to resolve. If the resolution requires a Variation, the instruction shall so require under clause 6.2.
	- If the Architect's design does comply, but the design does not work due to design conflict, the Architect must change the design to make it work and this requires a Variation with instruction.
- As transpired from the above, none of the Architect's allegations can support his refusal of issuing an instruction to resolve the design conflict of the underground drainage system

## Question

Question No. 2 – Late Variation

You are the contractor QS of a private residential development in Tuen Mun. The development comprises 12 individual houses. The designs of the houses are all identical. This morning, the Employer informed the project team that he has selected a different type of natural stone finish on the bathroom walls. The size is also changed from the 300×300×12mm thick to 600×600×20mm thick. Both are from Italy but different suppliers. The shipment of the originally specified stone is separated into two batches. Now, the 1st batch of the originally specified stone is being delivered to the Contractor’s fabrication yard in Dongguan, China and will arrive next week. The 2nd batch will depart Italy a few days later and is currently on hold. Total quantity of the stone finish measured in BQ=480m2 .

The changes will obviously have impact on the overall programme. In view of such major changes, the Employer requested you to submit the cost estimate for the change for joint review tomorrow.

Your assistant has prepared a draft cost estimate for the changes for your review. Please write some notes to your assistant to ensure that the draft will fully address the cost implication for your assistant to revise before submission. Alternatively, you may prepare a pro-forma cost estimate to list out the items with sufficient descriptions to highlight what would be considered for your assistant to complete the cost estimate.

^ Contract rate for supply and fix without overpricing or underpricing.

FOB = Free On Board.

The quantity in BQ is correct.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- It should be noted that the all-in rate for the new stone estimated by the assistant is by adding the difference between the two FOB rates to the contract rate. This is inappropriate because the two types of stones have different sizes, thickness, weights, base supply costs, times of ordering / fabrication / installation, exchange rates, etc which will result in different supply and fabrication on-costs, fixing costs, and the overall mark-up for profit and overheads
- The simplest approach would be to omit the original all-in price for the original stone, then add the abortive costs of the supply of the original stone and the all-in price for the new stone
- The abortive costs of the supply can be based on the current estimate of the actual costs of supply without cancellation
- The abortive materials if fully paid by the Employer shall become the property of the Employer and the abortive costs should include the storage costs and costs of delivery to the Employer's chosen places
- The two batches may be re-sold or re-used elsewhere or disposed of. The 2nd batch may be cancelled subject to cancellation charges. It would not be possible to estimate the credit value by tomorrow. Either the cost estimate should remain silent on this point (until the Employer asks) or a note be stated of such possibility.
- Since this is a cost estimate, it should be sufficient. The all-in rate for the supply and fix of the new stone should be based on the current costs of supply and fix plus profit and overheads. Whether the original price levels should be kept unchanged should be something to be dealt with when actually agreeing the variation.
- The following "add-on" items shall be added to the FOB cost to give the full supply and fabrication cost:
	- Allowance for cutting and installation wastage
	- Shipping insurance
	- Delivery from the port to the fabrication yard
	- Fabrication (usually cutting the stone slab to size and surface treatment)
	- Delivery from the fabrication yard to the site in Hong Kong
	- Off-sit storage (if required)
	- Import tax and VAT
- The cost of fixing the new stone may increase due to changed sizes, thickness and weight of stone. Dry fixing method may be required. If the stone has special stone pattern, this will also increase the fixing cost.
- Additional design work e.g. preparation of revised shop drawings, coordination with other trades etc should be included
- Mark-up for Contractor's profit and overheads to arrive at the all-in rate
- Bonus: potential cost implication to other fittings e.g. vanity counters, mirror cabinets due to the change in details of interface, or a statement that such costs are excluded
- An estimate of the loss and expense claim due to prolongation of the overall construction period. It should be clearly stated that this is just an estimate.

`#EOT 
## Question

Question No. 3 – Mitigation of Delay

Your firm is the consultant QS appointed by ABC Recreation Club who is developing a new 4-storey sports complex. The main building contract period is 30 months. The official opening date will be 3 months later after allowing for some delays and for the Club’s operation team to carry out pre-opening preparation. It is now at the mid-point of the construction. Due to the delay of the structural works caused by instructed Variations, the Contractor has reported an overall delay of 2 months and given notice of delay according to the Contract. According to the latest master programme, G/F and 1/F where the lobby, gymnasium and F&B are located will be completed by the Completion Date with no delay. However, 2/F and 3/F where sports halls and changing rooms are located will be completed 2 months behind the original schedule. The Architect is seeking your advice on the following:

(a) While the delay of the structural works was not caused by the Contractor, the Architect wonders whether full extension of time of 2 months should be granted when ceasing the following arrangements affecting the Contractor’s productivity can mitigate the effect of the delay a lot such that the extension of time can be less:

(1) The Contractor’s workers often take afternoon tea break; and (2) Some materials are delivered to Hong Kong by sea, not by air, leaving no float time in the programme.

(b) Propose five brave ideas to mitigate the delay to the originally scheduled official opening date. They can become the details of the delivery recovery / acceleration measures to be implemented by the Contractor and the Club jointly or separately. Cost increase and negotiation beyond the existing provisions are expected. There is no need to quote contract clauses.

Please draft a reply email for your senior to review before it is sent to the Architect.

## Assessor Notes

- EOT v tea break / delivery by sea
	- It is an implied contract term that subject to compliance with the requirements regarding design, materials and workmanship, how to plant to have the Works carried out should be at the discretion of the Contractor
	- Bonus: Conditions of Contract do require the Contractor to submit the master programme upon commencement of the Works for information under clause 3.1. However, there is no specific requirement for the Architect to comment, though the Preliminaries usually say that the programme should be approved by the Architect.
	- Bonus: Customarily, the Architect would review whether the activities are logical and the time periods are reasonable. He may comment that some activities or milestones have been planned too late such that the risk of actual delay to the overall completion date may be high. He may comment that some activities have been planned too early for him to provide information to meet such that the Contractor may easily claim EOT.
	- Giving worker's tea breaks is an industry norm. Delivery by sea is also the default practice. Delivery by air is for special cases only.
	- If the Contractor's programme can afford to have workers' tea breaks and delivery by sea, while still meeting the overall completion date, he is entitled to do so. The Contractor cannot be required to increase the explicit float times, though a prudent contractor should allow for implicit buffers in the activities.
	- If the Contractor's current progress is critically delayed by a certain period, the EOT should compensate that period lost to the same extent.
	- Bonus: For example, if the Contractor is instructed (not due to his fault) to stop work for 1 days, he should be compensated for 1 day. It would not be reasonable to say that he still has 100 working days to complete the Works that he should absorb that 1-day delay totally or partially because 1/100 is a small percentage, otherwise, this would mean that the Contractor will not actually be compensated for the 1 day lost.
	- If the tea breaks are cancelled, the workers' benefits will be affected and they will demand higher pay for the increased working hours if not leaving the project. If the delivery by sea is changed to by air, the costs of delivery will be increased. The Contractor would not have allowed such additional costs and should therefore not be required to bear the costs
	- Clause 25.1(4) does required the Contractor to use his best endeavors to mitigate the effect of any delays, but it does not mean that he has to reduce his remaining time to make up sum of the culpable delay. It further says that the endeavors should not increase the Contractor's cost.
- Ideas to mitigate the delay
	- Review to resolve any outstanding design or statutory approvals and consents
	- Request Contractor to increase the manpower and work overtime including night shifts and on Sundays and holidays
	- Request Contractor to use express delivery of materials
	- Change to use materials of shorter delivery periods
	- Change to adopt work requiring shorter time to complete
	- Omit work which is not essential  for immediate use
	- Defer non-essential work not required for Occupation Permit until after Substantial Completion
	- Reduce the time needed for pre-opening preparation by acceleration measures
	- Take partial possession of G/F and 1/F as per the original schedule by obtaining Contractor's consent to start and finish the pre-opening preparation on these two floors earlier so that more resources can be allocated to carry out the pre-opening preparation on the remaining floors later on
	- Break down the 2/F and 3/F into more parts for partial possession with the Contractor's consent to start partial pre-opening preparation earlier
	- Apply for temporary occupation permit and open up none or part of the sport hall floors only on the official opening date
	- Only carry out the official opening ceremony on site with other big gathering done elsewhere

## Question

Question No. 4 – Final Account

Your company is the consultant QS for an institutional project with the ground investigation works completed two weeks ago. You have prepared the draft final account based on the ground investigation report (the “Report”) approved by the Engineer who takes the role of the “Architect” under the Contract. The ground investigation contract is a remeasurement contract with provisional BQ prepared by the Engineer.

Upon the Employer’s review, he raised the following queries:

(a) It is recorded in the Report that there was substantial amount of drilling through rock or boulders. According to the specification below, N-size drilling casing should be used for boring through rock or boulders. However, in the draft final account, there are more quantities of H-size drilling casing for drilling through soil. It is noticed the contract rate for H-size drilling is much higher than that for N-size drilling. The Engineer said the Contractor carried out the works with H-size drilling casing without informing the Engineer until the works were almost completed on site. The sample by H-size drilling casing was however found acceptable by the Engineer. Therefore, the Engineer did not instruct the Contractor to carry out the works in N-size drilling again.

“Drilling through soil shall normally be carried out by advancing H-size drill casing using water flush, unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or instructed by the Engineer.

Drilling through rock, boulders, concrete, etc. Shall normally be carried out using N-size drill casing to produce cores not less than 76mm diameter, unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or instructed by the Engineer.”

Please advise if the remeasurement shall be based on the size of drilling casing actually adopted OR it shall be in accordance with the specification.

As a matter of interest, what would be the case had the Contractor sought the Engineer’s approval prior to any field works?

(b) In the BQ, item 1.09 – an “Extra over” item for drilling through rock or boulders is given separately. See below abstract from the draft final account. Since item 1.07 – N-size drilling is effectively for drilling through rock or boulders and the remeasured quantity of both items are the same, this “Extra over” item shall not be separately measured in the final account. Please advise.

| Item ref. | Description Drill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Qty  | Unit RUN | Rate     | Amount    |

(c) The specification sets out the guideline where the drillhole shall terminate depending on the quality of rock encountered. According to the Report, most drillholes terminate at a point deeper than that required by the specification. The Engineer however advised that it is within the acceptable tolerance range for termination. Please advise if the remeasurement shall be based on the actual length according to the Report OR the specification.

Please prepare a letter to address the Employer’s queries.

## Assessor Notes

- H-size drilling in lieu of N-size drilling
	- Without prior approval
		- The specification clearly states to use N-size drill "unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or instructed by the Engineer"
		- Without Engineer's instruction, Contractor shall not change the drilling from N-size to H-size for drilling through rock at his own discretion. Whether the sample is acceptable or not is irrelevant to the principle of remeasurement for the final account. There shall not be additional cost payable for non-conforming work accepted without rectification. If the cost is less, the acceptance without rectification may require price reduction.
		- SFBC clause 17.3(5) expressly provides for price reduction. Price reduction can be put forward as a condition of accepting non-conforming work.
		- The draft final account shall be revised to measure those H-size quantities as N-size which should have been done as N-size especially when the rate for N-size is lower
	- With prior approval
		- If the Contractor had sought the Engineer's approval prior to any field works, the work was authorised beforehand. If there was no clear agreement at the time of approving the Contractor's proposal, there can be argument over whether this should be treated as acceptance of the Contractor's proposal without cost effect or as an Engineer's instruction with cost effect.
		- Contractor may argue that he was only seeking a clarification instruction from the Engineer without any intent of putting forward a Contractor's proposal
		- The specification clauses are qualified by the words "normally" and "unless otherwise instructed by Engineer". This implies that the choice between H-size and N-size can be decided by Engineer. This would be particularly so when the Contract is a remeasurement contract.
		- Engineer may argue that it was Contractor who proposed first, he was only approving the Contractor's proposal without any intent to give higher price particularly when H-size is more expensive. 
		- It may be possible that when the Engineer approved, he was not aware of the higher rate for H-size. He raised argument now only because N-size has been priced cheaper than H-size. Had H-size been priced cheaper, no argument would be raised. It is not reasonable to choose the more favourable option after the event. Had the Engineer been aware of the higher rate, he should have dealt with the matter at the time of the approval.
		- A reasonable conclusion should be based on true intent with proof.
	- Measuring "extra over"
		- BQ item 1.07 is for drilling through soil in N-size, while item 1.09 is for the extra cost of that portion in rock out of the total length in item 1.07. These are clearly two different items and priced. Without the extra over item, the rate for item 1.07 should be the average of drilling though various materials. With the presence of the extra over item, the rate for item 1.07 shall no be deemed to include the extra cost in rock. Whether the two items should have the same remeasured quantities should be double-checked. If the drilling started from exposed rock surfaces, both quantities can be the same, otherwise, the draft final account should be revised.
	- Point of termination of drillholes
		- The actual quantities required for ground investigation depend greatly on the ground conditions encountered. That is why a remeasurement contract is used.
		- What the specification sets out are guidelines which do not necessarily work out an absolute point of termination. The point of termination depends on the ground condition with practical judgement by the Contractor and the Engineer as well. As the question says, the Engineer is satisfied that the point of termination is within the acceptable range of tolerance. It shall be regarded as a valid information for remeasurement.

You are requested by the in-house finance team to prepare a construction cost estimate by today for the facility for further internal review with other costs. The cost estimate should include a summary with elemental cost breakdown, a list of assumptions and exclusions. The elemental cost breakdown should show the major elements under each of structure, architectural works and building services. Some (but not exhaustive) approximate quantities or composite rate build-ups other than simple \1m2$ floor area should be given to show your ability to do so. Operational equipment can be excluded from the cost estimate. Please note the following as advised by the in-house engineer:

(a) It is a steel framed structure (structural steel ratio: 180kg/m2 CFA) on reinforced concrete footings.  
(b) Metal roof.  
(c) Metal perimeter wall panels.

Assume the design, provisions and standards for the rest.

#TenderAnalysis 
## Question

Question No. 2 – Tender Analysis

You are the consultant QS for a project involving fitting-out works in an existing commercial building. The tenders for the main contract were returned yesterday. It is a lump sum contract based on drawings and specifications. A schedule of rates without quantities was issued to the tenderers for pricing. All six tenderers submitted their tenders. The tender prices range from HK$30 million to HK$40 million.

The Employer’s Representative wrote you an email this morning:

---

Email from Employer’s Representative:

Dear QS,

Here are my initial comments on the pricing of the lowest tender submitted by Tenderer A:

a. The ground floor lift lobby ceiling lamps have been priced at HK$20,000/No. However, the supplier told me that the market rate is HK$10,000/No. I believe this item has been substantially over-priced.

b. The quantity of electrical power points is 100 No. It has been priced at HK$15,000/No., however, the extension amount inserted is HK$150,000, which was incorrectly calculated.

c. Page S3/4 of Schedule No. 3 – Finishes is missing from the submitted tender. However, the total of this page in the amount of HK$363,000 is shown on the collection page and carried to the Summary of Tender.

I understand you probably have picked up the above in your tender analysis. Since we are keen on the lowest tender, please advise in advance how the above should be dealt with, with explanation and the steps to take.

Thank you!

Employer’s Representative

---

Please reply to his email. It is assumed that the rules about assessing tenders in the conditions of tendering of the tender documents are not specific about the above three cases. State in the email what checks you have done. For item a, include in the email the possible reasons that the rate may or may not be over-priced.

[14 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Ground floor lift lobby ceiling lamps
	- Firstly, verify the rates inserted in the submitted SOR and quoted by supplier are as what the Employer's Representative said. Clarify with the supplier what are included in or excluded from his rate, e.g. delivery cost, power source, fixing accessories, sample, long delivery period, etc.
	- Check also if the quantity of lamps inserted is correct, or there may be pricing strategy, i.e. in anticipation of variation addition, though the chance appears to be small in the present case.
	- The tenderer may base on rates from another supplier
	- The tender rate should on top of the supply cost include installation cost, and contractor's profit and overheads. Complex hanging system, high ceiling height, and the need to assemble the lamps on site, associated alteration to existing ceiling, electrical work if no priced elsewhere, etc., can all increase the installation costs.
	- It would be reasonable to request the tenderer to submit rate breakdown or justification for review.
	- Bonus: There may be chances that this high rate can be used as pro-rata basis for other variation additions.
	- The tenderer may simply have made a mistake.
	- It is very likely that the Employer's Representative would like to ask for price reduction. However, as it is a lump sum tender, the tender sum should remain unchanged even if some of the price build-up is wrong. 
	- For high-priced items, it is a common practice for private projects to ask the tenderer to submit reasonable (reduced) rates or accept the assessed rate by the consultant QS for valuation of variation, in particular for those items likely to have variation additions, not variation omissions. The tender sum should remain unchanged. If the chance of variation is small, there may not be a real need to adjust the rates.
	- Bonus: If Employer ask for price reduction, this should be handled with care to avoid suspicion of collusion with that tenderer or unfairness to other tenderers. The shortlisted tenderers may be requested to submit their final sealed offers (after all the tender queries have been clarified) to be returned at the same time for final selection.
	- Bonus: It is also a common practice for private projects to agree more reasonable rate for low-priced items because low rates may be disadvantageous to the Employer in case of variation omissions. Professionally, the consultant QS should identify all incorrect high or low priced items for agreeing reasonable rates for valuation of variations whether they are omissions or additions so that the valuation themselves are fair and reasonable to both parties for changes in either direction, instead of selectively speculating to the Contractor's disadvantages all the time.
	- Bonus: Draw the design team's attention to the above for comments
	- Bonus: Assessed rates are normally not required for government contracts for high-priced or low-priced items. Instead, these items are detailed in the tender report for drawings the design team's attention to control the cost implication in the event of future variations.
- Error in rate but reasonable extension
	- Similar to Item A - check whether the Employer's Representative's observation is correct.
	- In this case, by comparison with the current market rates, mostly in the range between HK $1,000/No - HK $2,000/No for electrical power points in fitting out works of this nature, the tender rate at HK$15,000/No is considered substantially over-priced.
	- By dividing the extension amount by the quantity, the unit rate is HK$1,500/No which appears to be in line with the market rates.
	- Bonus: The typical conditions of tendering will specify that either the rate or the extension amount but not both can be corrected in case of mismatch. For example, if the rate derived by dividing the extension amount by the quantity is more reasonable by reference to similar items in the SOR, the extension can be adjusted to match. Unfortunately, the conditions of tendering for this tender are silent.
	- Bonus: if it were tendered based on BQ, then the quantity cannot be changed.
	- In case of mismatch error like 100 No @ $15,000/No = $150,000, where the arithmetically corrected extension amount is $1,500,000, the first thing is to check whether the tender sum is based on $150,000 or $1,500,000. If it is based on $1,500,000, then $150,000 is a typographical error to be corrected.
	- If the tender sum is based on $150,000, then the next step is to correct the unit rate to match the quantity. The unit rate will be $150,000 / 100 No = $1,500/No. If it is considered that $1,500/No is of reasonable order by comparing with other rates, then this rate should be adopted, notwithstanding whether the quantity is reasonable or not.
	- If the matching rate is not reasonable, the quantity may need to be checked to see whether it is reasonable. Since this is a SOR with quantities estimated by tenderer, the quantities may have been wrong. It is reasonable to request adjustment of the SOR such that the quantities are reasonable, and the rates are adjusted to match the reasonable quantities and the tender sum. The tender sum will still be binding.
	- If neither $150,000 nor $1,500,000 matches the tender sum, then the item can be corrected to reasonable quantity and reasonable rate. The resultant discrepancy with the tender sum should be treated as an aggregated arithmetical error.
	- Correction of contentious errors should be communicated to the tenderer to obtain agreement
	- Bonus: Depending on different consultant's or client's practice, correction of obvious arithmetical errors may not be communicated to the tenderers to obtain their agreements but would only be communicated with the successful tenderer during the post contract stage.
- Missing page
	- Check if the page is missing from the submitted tender
	- Check if the items on that page are listed on other pages or merged with other items in SOR
	- Issue tender clarification requesting the tenderer to submit the missing page with the page total tally with the amount on the collection page. Since this request may provide an opportunity for the tenderer to improve his tender and result in an advantageous position over the other tenderer, upon submission of the missing page, the consultant QS should check the items, quantities and rates, and also compare with other tenders to ensure that the tenderer would not manipulate the unit rates to his advantage. Request for corrections are necessary 
	- In principle, the missing page should not affect the rule that the tender sum includes for the whole of the Works tendered for, the missing page contains useful information for valuation of interim payments and variations. As long as the risk of tenderer's intentional manipulation is eliminated, the request for submission for analysis and inclusion in the Contract is necessary.
	- Bonus: ASD would deem the items on missing page as priced at zero rates and treat the amount on collection page as an arithmetical error. This would cause inconvenience to the valuation of interim payments and variations. Furthermore, the arithmetical error may be big enough to be applied as a percentage adjustment to other rates.

## Question

Question No. 3 – Early Possession of Part of the Works by the Employer

As the project quantity surveyor of a consultant QS firm, you have prepared the draft tender documents for a composite development project including residential blocks and office blocks on a single site. In the draft tender documents, both the residential blocks and the office blocks are stated to be completed on the same day.

During a project meeting with the Project Manager reviewing the draft tender documents, you were informed by the Project Manager that the Employer would like to:

a. have the residential blocks completed before the completion of the office blocks; and  
b. take possession of the residential blocks once completed irrespective of the contractual completion date.

Please draft a memo to advise the Project Manager whether the form of contract permits this, how the tender documents should be drafted, and what are the relevant contractual procedural implications. Write in your own words instead of copying verbatim from the contract clauses.

[10 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Having residential blocks completed earlier
	- Feasibility
		- To have the residential blocks completed before the completion of the office blocks, it should first physically be feasible in terms of the durations, and in terms of no or very little dependency by the residential blocks on the office blocks.
		- SFBC have provisions for sectional completion of the Works whereby different sections of the Works are required to be completed by different completion date or date for completion
		- All sections are governed by the same provisions for EOT and LAD for delay
	- Draft tender doc
		- If it is physically feasible, then it is a matter of defining the respective scope of works, specifying two completion dates with earlier one for the residential blocks, and different rates of LAD for delay to respective completion in the tender documents.
		- It is expected the residential blocks and office blocks are priced separately in the tender submission. Any other part of the works that should be included in the earlier section for the residential blocks should also be priced separately.
	- Operation
		- If a section of the Works is completed late beyond the extended completion date, LAD can be imposed.
		- The programme should reflect the sectional completion requirements. The statutory inspection times for OP will be different.
		- The substantial completion of a section shall be certified by Architect, and the Employer can then take over the section for use and occupation.
		- Half of the relevant retention shall be released upon substantial completion of a section.
		- Each section have its own DLP and defects rectification certificate after completion of defects rectification.
- Take possession once completed
	- Feasibility
		- In theory, Contractor would like to hand over any section of the Works to the Employer once completed
		- Assuming that the Employer wants to take possession before the residential blocks can be fully certified as substantially completed, SFBC clause 18 permits this and calls this "Partial Possession" of part of the Works or part of a section of the Works. However this requires the Contractor's consent. 
	- Draft tender doc
		- It may be amended by a special conditions of contract that no consent is required.
	- Operation
		- Once the possession is taken, the Architect has to certify that the part taken over shall be deemed to have been substantially completed
		- Employer will be responsible for the care of the part taken over
		- Rate of LAD shall be reduced in proportion to the value of the part taken over
		- Half of relevant retention related to the value of the part taken over shall be released
		- DLP shall start and finish early correspondingly

#LAD 
## Question

Question No. 1 – Late Commencement & Liquidated and Ascertained Damages

- **Part A**
	Now is 17 February 2020.
	
	You are the Consultant QS of a proposed commercial development. The development consists of a basement carpark, podium shopping arcade and a 40- storey tower. The original Contract Commencement Date (in SFBC term, or “date for commencement of the Works” in GCC term) was 15 March 2020, and the Contract Period was planned to be 30 months. The Contract was awarded to the Contractor in December 2019.
	
	With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the sales and leasing department of the Employer worried about the economic situation and recommended putting on hold the proposed commercial development. After internal discussion, the Employer decided last week to postpone the Contract Commencement Date to 15 March 2021. At this time, the Employer has not yet given possession of the Site to the Contractor. The site possession should be given on or before the Contract Commencement Date.
	
	The Project Manager suggested that the original Contract Commencement Date should be followed and an extension of time (EOT) would then be granted to cover the postponement of possession of the Site from 1 March 2020 to 14 March 2021. He considered that this could keep the Contractor in place. The Employer would like to seek your advice on the pros and cons of the Project Manager’s suggestion.
	
	Please draft a letter to advise the Employer accordingly.

- **Part B**
	Now is 15 November 2023.
	
	The construction eventually commenced on 15 March 2021. However, the project was further delayed by some other incidents. By now, the Works were almost completed, the Contractor learnt that the Employer was preparing to enforce the liquidated and ascertained damages (LAD) clause. Apart from arguing for the entitlement to EOT under the Contract, the Contractor decided to challenge the LAD provision in the Contract and just wrote a letter to the Project Manager and the Employer, arguing that the LAD provision should not be enforced for the following two main reasons:
	
	a. Different LAD rates have been specified for different completion milestones, and higher rates have been specified for completion milestones close to the end of the project. This is a sign of the LAD rates not representing the actual loss suffered by the Employer based on the logic that the closer to the end of the project the lesser the loss suffered by the Employer; and
	
	b. The LAD rates are unreasonably high when compared with all the projects of similar nature, size, scale, and period of time.

After reading the letter, the Project Manager sent an email to you to seek advice on whether the Contractor can successfully challenge the LAD provision. Please draft an email to advise the Project Manager accordingly.

[14 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- A. Follow original Contract Commencement Date 
	- PM suggested that the original Contract Commencement Date should be followed and an EOT would then be granted to cover the postponement of possession of the site from 1/3/2020 - 14/3/2021.
	- Pros
		- Generally, a significant revision of the commencement date can be considered as a change to one of the fundamental terms and conditions of a contract. The Contractor may argue that he has the right not to accept the change, but treat the contract as invalidated. Since clause 25.1(3)(j)(ii) permits extension of time for completion due to this revision, the argument should not stand, but keeping the Commencement Date unchanged can at least avoid this argument. (Bonus: Changing the Commencement Date of the Works or site possession date would not invalidate the Contract, and all the contract terms and conditions should remain intact)
		- Postponement of the Contract Commencement Date shall have both contractual and financial implications. Clause 25.1(3)(j)(ii) permits EOT for completion. Clause 27.1(2)(e)(ii) permits compensation of direct loss and expense. Clause 36.1(1)(d) permits the Contractor to determine his employment if the postponement of the Commencement Date is 120 days or more. Therefore, keeping the Commencement Date unchanged appears to be able to avoid all these implications.
		- If the original Contract Commencement Date is followed, there is no change to the terms and conditions of the awarded Contract. This provides certainty to the arrangement of the Works at the beginning of the project. This can avoid the Contractor's argument that he is only obliged to start any work or services forming part of the Works starting from the Contract Commencement Date (an argument on the incorrect assumption that the Contract Commencement Date is equal to the date of commencement of the Contract; "Contract Commencement Date" should more properly mean the original date for commencement of the Works, not the Contract)
		- With the Contract Commencement Date followed, the Contractor has to comply with his obligations under the Contract, which is in the interest of the project. For instance, the Contractor can carry out coordination with the Architect, other consultants, sub-contractors, specialist contractors, statutory undertakers, etc., shop drawing submissions, statutory applications, etc. (Bonus: Contractor can still be required to do so if the Contract Commencement Date is not followed.)
		- There will be no need to deal with or negotiate the postponement of the Contract Commencement Date (Bonus: However, there will still be a need to deal with the contractual and financial implications of postponement of site possession, which are very similar. A possible difference is that there is no clause like clause 36.1(1)(d) permitting the Contractor to determine his employment. Clause 36.1(1) does not mention "possession". However, clause 36.1(1)(e) permits the Contractor to determine his employment due to suspension of the carrying out of the Works for 120 days or more. Although it may be argued that suspension is different from possession, if commencement of the Works is deemed effective, suspension of the carrying out of the Works due to lack of site may also be considered as covered by clause 36.1(1)(e).)
		- Only the postponement of the site possession would need to be handled. The postponement may be implemented in a progressively incremental manner in light of the development of the pandemic. This may be more flexible than postponing the Contract Commencement Date once and for all or in an incremental manner.
	- Cons
		- The use of keeping the Contractor in place when the Contractor has no physical work to do appears to be not much. Additional loss and expense will be incurred if the Contractor is to keep some project staff during the period of no physical works.
		- If there is no negotiation regarding postponement of site possession, the Employer can only have the knowledge about the Contractor's additional costs by the time the claim for loss and expense is submitted by the Contractor
	- Therefore, the pros as may be conceived by PM do not appear to be too many, but on balance, following the Contract Commencement Date would cause less room for argument.
	- What is more important is to agree with the Contractor that the postponement would not trigger the determination clause.
- B. LAD challenge
	- The rate of LAD is a pre-agreed rate between Employer and Contractor for the damages to be paid by the Contractor is the Contractor fails to complete the Works on time
	- It is general rule that the rate of LAD should be a genuine pre-estimate of the loss that the Employer would suffer. The Courts will not enforce the LAD provision if they find the rate of LAD not a genuine pre-estimate of the loss, but extravagant and punitive. However, so long as it is genuine at the time of the estimate, it does not matter if the actual loss turns out to be very different in the future.
	- Bonus: It may be argued that the Contractor has agreed to the rate of LAD by signing the Contract, but the Courts do deal with the challenges and accept the challenges in some cases.
	- Different LAD rates for different milestones
		- So long as the total of LAD rates of various milestones are not bigger than the reasonable rate of LAD if there is only one completion date, then higher LAD rates for later milestones are not self-evident that such higher LAD rates were not genuine pre-estimate of the loss, take for example that the earlier milestone is for the completion of a part of the Works while the later milestone is for the the completion of twice the size of the previous part.
		- Only if the functional value of the later milestone is bigger than the functional value of the earlier milestone, the challenge may stand. However, the LAD rates specified in the Contract may have been set smaller than the genuine pre-estimates of the loss because if the genuine rates are used, the tenderers may be deferred from tendering or may have to allow for a huge price for the risks. Therefore, the LAD rates may be discounted rates, but because the later milestones are more important, higher LAD rates have been specified.
		- If the above examples still cannot convince Contractor, the Contractor should be required to submit his proof that the LAD rates are not genuine pre-estimate of loss. On the other hand, if Employer can prove that they are genuine pre-estimate of loss, the LAD rates should still be enforceable.
	- LAD rate higher than other projects
		- The fact that the LAD rates are higher than other similar projects does not mean that LAD rates are unreasonable.
		- LAD rates may take into account the following loss and expense caused by late completion:-
			- Loss of sales of the completed properties
			- Loss of rental income from the completed properties
			- Extra opening / pre-opening costs
			- Extra operation costs
			- Extra staff cost in handling project delay
			- Extra professional fees, legal costs, agency fees, etc.
			- Compensation for any breach of agreements in connection with the delayed use of the properties
			- Extra statutory fees, government rents or rates, etc.
			- Extra financing costs
		- The magnitude of the above items may vary a lot among different companies and similar projects. Furthermore, as mentioned above, LAD rates may be subject to different discounts by different companies for different projects. Therefore, the apparent difference in LAD rates cannot be a ready proof that the LAD rates are unreasonable.
		- As mentioned above, if the Employer can prove that they are genuine pre-estimate of loss, the LAD rates should still be enforceable
	- Bonus: able to discuss the difference between LAD and delay damages, and able to point out the LAD in the question is the same as the damages for non-completion in SFBC clause 24
	- Bonus: able to point out that even if Contractor can successfully challenge LAD provision, Employer may claim for unliquidated damages as a result of the delayed completion caused by Contract.

## Question

Question No. 2 – Request for Architect’s Instructions

You are an in-house QS of a Developer and are currently looking after a commercial redevelopment project. The construction of the structural frame has just commenced. During the site meeting this morning, the Contractor raised his concern about the Architect’s outstanding response to quite a number of his requests for Architect’s instructions (RAI) and subsequent delay in certifying payment for the corresponding work done as mentioned in the RAI.

At the meeting, the Contractor chased the Architect’s response to a particular RAI. Almost two months ago, the Contractor submitted a proposal for using bricklaying robot instead of manual construction. Its main advantages are time saving in constructing brick walls, enhanced site safety and reduced defects, which are agreed by the Architect. The Contractor also attached a quotation of HK$300,000 to his proposal. The Contractor subsequently submitted a RAI for confirmation of his proposal. The Architect believes his confirmation by an AI may constitute a Variation instruction with agreement to the Contractor’s quotation. Also, the Architect considers the main advantages are effectively saving the Contractor’s costs and not justifying additional payment by the Employer. The Architect therefore hesitates to respond to the Contractor’s RAI.

A. By an e-mail, share your view with the Architect on making decision regarding the RAI using bricklaying robot. Your view shall include:

1. Whether the Architect needs to reply to this RAI;
2. Whether the reply has to be an AI; and
3. Whether the main advantages justify a Variation; 

B. Suggest by another e-mail to the consultant team and the Contractor practical measures to control RAI and manage the process efficiently.

## Assessor Notes

- A. RAI regarding bricklaying robot
	- Whether to respond
		- Under SFBC 2005 clause 1.11(1) or SFBC 2006 clause 1.12, Employer, Contractor, Architect and QS shall act reasonably and expeditiously in all matters under the Contract including without limitation, giving or withholding consent, approval or agreement, valuing Variations and certifying. It is therefore contractually acceptable for the Contractor to ask for the Architect's response by raising his request, and Architect shall respond within a reasonable time frame.
		- Under SFBC clause 4.2(1), Contractor has the right to confirm in writing the Architect's oral instruction requiring Variation, and if the Architect does not dissent within 7 days, the Variation shall be deemed to be valid, and the Architect should still issue a written instruction for record purposes. Therefore, Architect's explicit response if essential for good and proper contract administration.
	- Whether response must be AI
		- SFBC clause 4 stipulates the issue of Architect's instructions. It does not require it to be in any particular format so long as it is in writing.
		- Not all types of responses shall be in the form of AI. Architect's response can be given in different forms depending on the nature of the response and any pre-agreement with the project team with the aim of proper daily contract administration. It should be mindful not to abuse the function of documents like site memo, email, letter, web-based notification and other common communication forms by incorporating "instructions" that should be in the form of AI.
		- Under clause 1.6, Variation is defined as a change instructed by Architect to the design, quality or quantity of the Works. SFBC clause 13.1 requires an AI to be issued for a Variation. However, an AI does not necessarily involve a Variation.
		- While SFBC do not have such a clause, it is usual for the Preliminaries to contain a clause saying "Any proposal made by the Contractor and approved by the Architect shall be deemed to have no cost or time effect on the Contract unless the Contractor expressly states that there should be cost or time effect when submitting the proposal and the Architect confirms in writing to treat this proposal as a Variation when accepting the proposal."
		- Assuming that the present Contract does not contain this Preliminaries clause, the use of bricklaying robot was proposed by Contractor and was not a change instructed by Architect, so it does not constitute a Variation even though there may be benefits to the Employer.
		- As the Contractor has changed his method of working and the use of robot has not been anticipated in the Specification, it is prudent or even necessary for the Contractor to seek Architect's approval of the use of robot. The Architect should therefore respond to the proposal.
		- As the Contractor is expecting additional payment for the use of bricklaying robot, the Architect may respond that the approval is subject to no additional cost or time to the Contract. It will be up to the Contractor to proceed with the proposal or not. There should not be a need for reply to be in the form of AI, however, since an AI does not automatically involve a Variation, use of an AI is still permissible but for the avoidance of doubt, the AI should say beyond doubt that it is approving the Contractor's proposal without cost or time effect.
		- If Contractor does not proceed with the proposal in view of no cost or time effect, but the Architect and Employer consider that the proposal is desirable, they may agree the cost or time effect with the Contractor and record the agreement in writing in the form of AI.
	- Whether advantages justify Variation
		- The main advantages as suggested by Contractor and agreed by the Architect are time saving in constructing brick walls, enhanced site safety and reduced defects. Reducing defects mainly benefits the Contractor. Enhanced site safety would benefit Contractor but also the Employer against the risks of accidents arising. Time saving mainly benefits the Contractor unless the saving in time can be shared with the Employer. If there are benefits which can be shared with the Employer in a definite manner, then it would be reasonable to agree some compensation towards the amount quoted, and treat the changes as an acceptance of Contractor's proposal with cost or time effects. Such an agreement should be recorded in writing, the form can be flexible but preferably by AI.
- B. Practical measures to control RAI and manage the process efficiently
	- Submit estimates (by Contractor or QS) for proposed variations to assist the Employer to decide whether to require the variations or not
	- Issue proper AI in writing instead of oral instruction, site memo or other forms of instructions to reduce the need for Contractor to raise RAI 
	- Issue AI or VO as soon as possible after the oral instruction, site memo or similar is given to reduce the need for the Contractor to issue RAI
	- Categorise and prioritise the RAI to respond
	- Establish clear procedure and specific time frame, if not already in the contract, for initiating variations, estimating cost implication, approval and issuance
	- Ensure AI or VO are issued with sufficient and accurate information for defining scope of variation for execution
	- Agreement standard form of AI or VO, RAI and other related documents to ensure the information attached to the form is sufficient for valuation
	- Hold regular meetings preferably on site to clear the backlog, with attendance of the relevant parties. Conduct joint site inspections if necessary
	- If there is any argument over the validity of a RAI in particular those with major cost implications, break down the work in the RAI and proceed with the valuation of those agreed parts for interim payment
	- Maintain a live master copy of RAI and AI or VO for access for relevant parties with automatic overdue warning notice
	- Submit quotations for variation with full supporting details before payment applications. Submit breakdown for pro-rata or star rates. Submit suppliers' invoices and receipt
	- Request COW to endorse quantity record of work or delivery
	- Seek Architect's confirmation if the quotations include work not covered by AI or VO before submitting or as soon as possible after submitting the quotations.
	- Include in payment certificates the values of variations with AI or VO without necessarily agreeing the values
	- Agree the values of variations regularly. Hold meetings as necessary
	- Bonus: Embed the Employer's in-house approval procedure, if any, in the contractual time frame
	- Bonus: Deploy resident site staff of relevant parties to increase efficiency of clarifying details in relation to site matters

## Question

Question No. 3 – Claims for Additional Payment

You are the Consultant QS for a fitting out contract for a residential development. It is a lump sum contract based on drawings and specification. The Contractor intends to claim additional payment under the Contract as described below:

a. The finishes schedule on a Contract Drawing shows that ceramic tiles of 300 ×300×12mm×300×12mm thick laid on 10mm thick cement and sand backing with cement grouting should be applied to the walls of the main entrance lobby of the residential tower. The layout plan of such a lobby shows the extent of the same. However, all elevations of the lobby are shown on the Contract Drawings except the dead-end wall. The Contractor claims he is entitled to additional payment for the ceramic tiles on that dead-end wall.

b. The Technical Specification specifies the performance requirements of the ceramic tiles. The Architect has admitted that it is actually based on the technical data of a particular European brand “X” without specifying the brand name. It is also written in the Technical Specification that “equivalent products are acceptable subject to the Architect’s approval”. The Contractor proposed an alternative product of another brand “S”. The Architect disapproved because there exists difference though minor in the technical data of brand “S” and the Specification, i.e., brand “X” and so he requested the Contractor to propose brand “X”. The Contractor argues that brand “S” is considered as an equivalent product. Should the Architect insist using brand “X” ceramic tiles instead of brand “S”, it should be assessed as an additional payment to the Contractor.

c. As per the elevation drawings (Contract Drawings), the setting out of the ceramic tiles are laid starting from the left-hand side of the walls. While on the revised elevation drawings, it shows that all the ceramic tiles should be fixed from the centerline of each wall. The Contractor claims that since the wastage of the ceramic tiles increases arising from the change of the fixing method, it should be assessed as an additional payment to him.

d. The Architect has instructed the Contractor to use epoxy grout instead of cement grout for the above ceramic tiles. The material cost difference has been assessed by you. The Contractor also claims for the increase in cost due to more complicated workmanship and his payment of special bonus (with proof of payment) for securing the skilled workers for the work have not been considered in your assessment.

The Architect requested you to advise on the acceptability of the Contractor’s arguments. If the Contractor’s argument(s) is/are considered valid, in the above case(s), does the Contractor have to submit notice of claim and what is the relevant contract provision involved? If notice of claim is required, what are the timeline specified in the Contract for the Contractor to submit such notice of claim for additional payment, what are the consequence if the Contractor has not complied with these requirements. Please prepare a letter to the Architect to explain your considerations.

## Assessor Notes

- A. Tile not shown on elevation
	- Finishes schedule has specified the wall finishes to the main entrance lobby. Although the elevation of the dead-end wall has not been shown on the Contract Drawings, it is reasonable expect that the wall finishes should be applied to all the wall surfaces of relevant room without the need to show all the elevations. In fact, the Contract Drawings also have not shown all the elevations for all the rooms, and have not shown other wall finishes to the dead-end wall. An average competent contractor can estimate the quantities showing the design intent. Therefore, it is considered that the Contractor's argument is not valid
	- If the Contractor does not agree with the above interpretation, he should follow SFBC clause 28 requirements for any additional payment. The NOC must be submitted within 28 days of it becoming apparent to the Contractor that an event has occurred which gives rise to a claim, and he shall include in the notice the contractual provisions upon which the claim is based. According to clause 28.3, the Contractor must comply with the time frame and procedures stated in clause 28.1 and 28.2, otherwise, the claim will be deemed to have been waived by the Contractor. Such a clause is not applicable to valid variations. Normally, quotations and revised quotations are submitted for variations for agreement with QS without the need to escalate to a claims. 
	- Bonus: Clause 28 does not define the time "when an event has occurred", it may be argued that the event time is not the time of carrying out the alleged variation but the time of disagreement. This will then escape the time restriction specified in clause 28.
	- Bonus: Some Candidates may raise the importance of checking other parts of the Contract, e.g. tender correspondence, specification, that may contain clarification on the finishes requirements
	- Bonus: Seek further advice from Architect on the interpretation of the design intent in determining the Contractor's entitlement to additional payment
- B. Equivalent material not approved
	- Architect shall determine whether the minor difference in the technical data is so important that it will cause noticeable impact on the performance of the ceramic tiles. 
	- It is believed that products of different brands are carrying some variance in the technical data to certain extent. If the variance stays within the range of tolerance, the Contractor's proposed brand "s" should be considered as "equivalent" under the Contract. The fact that the contract specification is actually based on the technical data of brand "X" is irrelevant because this has not been notified in the tender documents. The contract specification should be interpreted according to the standard of the average competent person of the same calling. 
	- Using brand "S" as proposed by the Contractor as an acceptable equivalent should not constitute a Variation. If the minor difference should objectively be accepted, but the Architect insists on using brand "X", it shall be instructed as Variation. The valuation of this Variation is basically the delta between the market prices of brand "S" and brand "X" plus related profit and overheads. 
	- Clause 28 notice of claim for additional payment is not required for Variation.
- C. Different setting out starting point
	- The elevation drawings have specified the setting out requirements, it is reasonable for the Contractor to allow for the tile wastage based on the Contract Drawings' setting out. Any revision to the setting out drawings affecting the wastage of tiles should entitle the Contractor to additional payment. 
	- Some Candidates may refer to the preambles which typically say that the rates shall include for different types of fixing methods or "laid in pattern". However, it does not mean that the rates should cover any types of fixing methods
	- If there are no express methods shown in the Contract Drawings or Specification, the methods commonly adopted should be argued for.
	- However, since the Contract Drawings have expressly shown the fixing method, the rates should be deemed to cover the shown method only. The Contractor shall show the difference in wastage due to the different fixing methods.
	- NOC is not required for Variation.
- D. Extra labour cost for change cement grout to expoxy grout
	- For the change of cement grout to epoxy grout instruction, firstly, it is necessary to establish if the Contractor's argument regarding the workmanship and skilled labour is correct or not. It can be resolved by asking the Contractor to substantiate the additional resources incurred. The Consultant QS may make his judgement as a normal part of the rate build-up or in case of doubt, he should ask Architect's or COW's comments, the Consultant QS shall then assess the additional amount and add it to the overall assessment.
	- Regarding the special bonus for securing the skilled workers, it should be checked whether the special bonus actually means the normal higher pay for such kind of skilled workers. If it is, the QS can consider in the valuation. However, if it is due to the need to accelerate work to carry out special measures, then the reasons to do so should be justified as due to the direct consequence of this AI before the special bonus is admitted into the valuation. In case of doubt, the QS should seek Architect's comments. 
	- NOC is not required for Variation except for the part disagreed.

#Estimate 
## Question

You are the in-house QS of a technology park managed by TPark. TPark is developing a vacant site inside the park into an administration building. It is now at the Scheme Design stage. The project particulars and preliminary cost estimate (prepared by the consultant QS) of the current design are shown in Attachment A.

TPark's Project Director has urgently requested you to study the construction cost implications of the following two design options for discussion tomorrow:

A.           Prepare a ballpark estimate of the additional construction cost of adding a single level basement carpark (see Attachment B) of 3m storey height. It is anticipated that the underground condition is without rock excavation or other unforeseen obstructions, but the water table is high. Open cut excavation is not feasible due to the site constraints.

[8 marks]

B.           Combine the 1"’ and 2nd floors of the administration building into a single double-height floor primarily for hosting conferences and exhibitions called “ConEx“ (See Attachment C). Other floors remain unchanged. Please, as an initial step, explain how the costs of building elements would be influenced. This is crucial for subsequent discussions with the project team to complete the cost study.

[8 marks]

Please respond to the Project Director \/ia an internal memo.

- Combine two floors of office to one floor of exhibition hall
	- Piling and substructure
		- The foundation design may change as a result of the changes in the total dead and live load as described under "structure" - likely cost increase
	- Structure
		- One level of floor slabs and beams will be omitted to create the double-storey - cost reduction
		- Staircases and lift shaft will be retained - minor cost effect
		- Lift shaft and escalator voids may need to be added - cost increase
		- Column and wall layout in the new floor will need to be changed, normally to longer column and walling space. A longer span transfer structure in the form of thicker slab or beam or even using prestressing or post-tensioning may therefore be required to support the upper floors - can be significant cost increase
		- Floor slab and beams will be strengthened to take heavier load - cost increase
		- Total required loading capacity may increase to accommodate greater live loads and support heavier equipment - cost increase
		- Hoisting, mounting and hanging structural steel frames may be required to serve the conference / exhibition equipment and partitioning  - cost increase
	- Facade
		- The design of facade to the new exhibition floor may be very different from that of the typical office floors, with possible use of more expensive glass wall / window wall to give open view, but also fitted with curtains and blinds - cost increase
		- The design of facade to the G/F may also be upgraded - cost increase
		- Main entrances will need to be enlarged to accommodate more people flow - cost increase
	- Architectural
		- The architectural interior of the two floors of administration offices, e.g. partitions, doors, finishes and office furniture will be omitted - cost reduction
		- In place thereof will be fewer rooms but more movable partitions, fewer but heavier doors, more expensive floor, wall and ceiling finishes, more expensive conference and exhibition fixed or loose furniture - net cost addition after the above cost reduction
		- Enlarging and upgrading of entrances / lift lobbies / front of house staircase / toilet to the new exhibition floor and G/F will be required - cost increase

		- Kitchen and eating places may be added - cost increase
		- Retractable or demountable seating may be required - cost increase
		- Additional access to accommodate special guest may be required - cost increase
	- Building Services
		- MVAC: exhibition hall may require larger MVAC systems with higher cooling capacities to maintain comfortable temperatures during events. The ventilation systems may also need to handle higher air exchange rates - cost increase
		- Acoustic: ductworks and MVAC system will need to be designed to minimize noise transmission - cost increase
		- Electric power: higher capacity and more flexible and movable power distribution system will be required - cost increase
		- Lighting - exhibition hall requires flexible lighting systems to accommodate various event setups and lighting scenarios. This may involve the use of dimmable lighting fixtures, programmable control systems, and stage lighting equipment to create different atmospheres and highlight specific areas during events - cost increase
		- Audio-visual system: exhibition hall has more complex audio-visual requirements compared to typical offices. This includes high-quality sound systems, video projection equipment, screens, microphones, and audio recording capabilities to support presentations, live performances, and multimedia displays - cost increase
		- Exhibition hall may require robust IT and communication infrastructure to support high-speed internet connectivity, video conferencing, live streaming, and other technological requirements for conferences and events. This may involve dedicated server rooms, network cabling, and audio-visual integration - cost increase
		- Additional lift or escalators may be required - cost increase

#Procurement 
## Question

You are the consultant QS preparing tender documents for a composite development with five high-rise residential towers and a shopping arcade at Sheung Shui in New Territories. The Employer is eager to have the whole development's construction completed as soon as possible.

The tenders for the foundation works are due to be invited in two weeks' time, followed later by the building works. The Architect and the Structural Engineer have obtained approvals for the General Building Plans (GBP), piled foundation plans and structural framing plans for the project. However, the Structural Engineer has raised concerns about incomplete schematic piling design due to insufficient boreholes being carried out. To address this issue, the Employer has suggested that further ground investigation works be carried out by the Foundation Contractor.

The Employer has also suggested to adopt concrete modular integrated construction (MiC) in lieu of in-situ concrete construction for the typical domestic floors of over 5,000 residential flats in the development, utilizing MiC system already approved by the Buildings Department. The access roads and storage space nearby are suitable for MiC construction. This change to MiC is intended to expedite the construction process and mitigate the concerns of time constraints. The Employer is aware that the adoption of MiC may induce additional costs but should have benefits in GFA concessions.

Please write a memo to the Employer to advise him on any cost and time complications when adopting his two time saving suggestions independently:

A.        Ground investigation works to be carried out by the Foundation Contractor.

B.        MiC to be adopted.

Please also include in the memo the cost and time complications if the above two suggestions are integrated in the following three ways of procurement also suggested by the Employer with the intention to save time:

C.       Foundation works and building works to be awarded respectively as two separate lump sum without quantities contracts.

D.     Design and construction of the Works as one single contract.

Include recommendations to resolve.

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- GI works by FDN
	- In the simplest term: this suggestion is not a good one because it is unlikely to advance the time to complete the foundation works but is likely to cause significant post contract additional time, costs, claims and arguments
	- Foundation Contractor can only tender based on the foundation design provided to him. If the foundation design is not complete, and the final design is different from the tendered foundation design, the time to complete will be increased or decreased depending on whether the design becomes more difficult or easier, but disruptive effects will most likely happen. The Contract Sum will need to be adjusted for the changed quantities. The contract rates may become not applicable if the types, sizes, lengths and depths of piles are changed. Contractor will likely take the opportunity to argue for better unit rates for the changes.
	- Recommendation
		- To reduce the arguments over the unit rates to be adopted for changes, the foundation tenderers may be required to quote unit rates for possible alternative types, sizes lengths, and depth of piles, as anticipated by SE.
		- To reduce the arguments over the time for completion, the foundation tenderers may be required to propose the completion times for different schemes of foundation systems of different types, number and dimensions, also as anticipated by SE.
		- To reduce the arguments over prolongation costs to be paid when the actual completion times are longer than the proposed completion times due to issues for which the Contractor is entitled to additional payments, the foundation tenderers may be required to quote for the daily charge of idling plant, idling staff and labour, prolonged use of site facilities, etc.
	- The above measures may help reduce the arguments but the varieties and combinations may be too many for the tenderers to quote competitively, and the assumptions may not be correct. The time and cost certainties are low before the foundation design is finalized.
	- Items for the GI works will also need to be included for tendering if the works are given to the Foundation Contractor to carry out.
	- Recommendation
		- A better way to resolve is to follow the normal practice of having the GI works fully carried out and the foundation design fully completed after that before calling for foundation tenders. Because the critical time to complete will in any case depend on the completion of the last pile for submission to BD for inspection. Such normal practice should not take longer time than deferring the GI works to the Foundation Contractor, because the time required to prepare tender documents, call for tenders and appoint the GI is relatively short. Negotiation with a trustworthy GI contractor can speed up the process, while any cost premium should be minor when compared with the foundation costs.
		- Since the site can accommodate 5 residential buildings, it may be investigated whether the foundation plan submissions can be split into more than one parcel so that each parcel can have its own completion date for the BD to inspect, so as to reduce the impact of any localized delay to the whole site. Such arrangement will need to be written into the tender documents and delineated on the site plans.
- MiC adoption
	- In the simplest term: while the adoption of MiC can reduce the overall time to complete after the award of the contract including MiC, and the foundation period should generally be long enough to accommodate the tender documentation, submission and award for the contract including MiC, critical time will be required to change the already approved BD submission drawings affecting the foundation works to incorporate the impact of MiC in order to obtain re-approval. The completion of the foundation works will still need to be deferred to match the re-approved drawings. All these may outweigh the possible time saving after awarding the contract including MiC.
	- If MiC is adopted for the typical domestic floors, the approved GBP, foundation plans and structural framing plans will have to be completely revised and resubmitted for approval. These drawings will likely have effect on the foundation design due to different loading and possibly different column and wall layout.
	- The two-week period left for issuance of foundation works tender documents will not be enough to incorporate the changes to the foundation design. If the foundation tenders are still invited based on the approved plans, there will be post contract changes to the foundation design, leading to complications similar to those described under A above.
	- The tender drawings and specification incorporating the idea of MiC should be prepared before they can be issued for calling for the tenders including MiC. The time required should generally be able to be accommodated during the foundation period.
	- However, the BD submission drawings incorporating MiC should be approved in good time so that the foundation works to be completed for the Building Department's inspection can match the approved BD submission drawings, otherwise, the foundation works will be rejected. Approval of major BD amendment submission will take 2 months.
	- Recommendation
		- To reduce the chances of deferring the foundation works and causing abortive work, the possible additional loading and varied column and wall layout should be determined and reflected in the foundation design as early as possible, and then such fixed criteria should be imposed as constraints in the tenders including MiC.
		- It is a good idea to adopt MiC design already approved by BD because it will shorten the time to design and obtain statutory approvals, provided it is usable for this project.
	- Bonus: the design of the concrete MiC modules for over 5000 residential units has to be limited to a few types for maximising the advantages of repetitiveness and economies of scale for enhancing efficiency and hence cost effectiveness
	- Bonus: MiC normally involves repetitive double walls between MiC modules, and thicker enclosure walls to cater for rigging and hoisting during transportation and assembly on site. This will increase pile loading and hence require foundation design revision.
	- Bonus: Use of MiC provides 10% floor area concession and the corresponding site coverage concession as well as supports applications for exceeding building height limits due to increase in floor area caused by the adoption of MiC
- FDN and BLD awarded as two separate lump sum without quantities contract
	- As a common principle, a complete set of detailed drawings and specifications and sufficient tendering period should be given for the tenderers to measure the quantities and price the works with certainty and to reduce post contract changes and cost and time increases
	- If the tenders for the foundation works are to be issued in two weeks' time as scheduled based on incomplete foundation design, the complications as described under A above will apply.
	- If MiC is adopted, the complications as described under B above will apply, more severely to the foundation works but less severely to the building works which will be tendered for later, presumably the foundation period should be sufficiently long to cover the tender documentation, tendering, tender analysis, and contract award for the building works
	- Awarding the building works separately and later can have the advantage of giving more time for the design of the building works while the foundation works are in progress
- D&B as one single contract
	- With this arrangement, the need to provide a complete set of detailed drawings and specifications as described above for tendering will be reduced, since the design time will be moved to post contract stage which can overlap with the construction works.

# 2024 D1Q3


- Incorporating lift installation programme
	- The at least 6-month period for lift installation should be specified in Main Contract with its starting date defined. It is usually counted from the date of handover the lift shafts and lift pits. 
	- The expected handover date should be specified by means of a fixed calendar date or a date relative to the commencement date of the Contract. This date must be achievable by the lift contractor, after taking into account the date of award of the lift contract, pre-ordering activities, ordering and delivery time. 
	- Bonus: more than one date may need to be specified, if there are very different lifts at different locations.
- Milestone or other provisions with LAD
	- A rate of LAD is usually specified in the Contract only for delay to the overall contract completion date or any specific sectional or phased completion date specified in the Contract. The names of such dates can vary between different standard forms of contract.
	- Except for those milestone dates representing those specific completion dates, rates of LAD are usually not specified for other milestone dates on the programmes. Missing those milestone dates may however be subject to general damages
	- To set a milestone date related to the lift installation with LAD imposable, such a milestone date should be defined as a section or phase in accordance with the general conditions of the standard form of contract with LAD imposable but also with EOT entitlement, otherwise, a set of special conditions of contract to that effect should be included.
	- That milestone date must be related to the expected handover date, not the 6-months period, though the 6-month period must also be specified.
	- Bonus: the 6-months period can be specified without the need to specify the milestone for handover because the Contractor will be obliged to afford the 6-month period even when the handover date is delayed.
- Estimating the rate of LAD
	- In case of delay to the expected handover date, the likely loss and expense which may be suffered by Employer will be the amount payable to the lift contractor for prolonged off-site storage of the lifts in the absence of free on-site storage, second transportation to the site if the lifts could have been delivered directly to the site after arrival to Hong Kong, inflationary effect on the installation costs, and some prolongation costs of the lift contractor's project staff, plus the Employer's own administrative expenses.
	- Bonus: the rate of LAD should be a genuine pre-estimate of loss and expense which may be suffered by Employer due to the failure to meet the handover milestone date. If it is excessively more than that, it will not be enforceable.
	- Bonus: the benefit of such rate of LAD is to remove the need to substantiate the actual loss and expense incurred.
	- Bonus: the rate will likely be small as compared to the full rate of LAD for delay to the overall completion of the Main Contract Works and is unlikely to have a very forceful effect to push to achieve the milestone date. Much time will need to be spent to assess the EOT related to the milestone date.
	- Bonus: If the Contractor fails to meet the handover milestone date and cannot subsequently catch up the delay, he will also be liable for the LAD related to the delayed completion of the Main Contract Works. The build-ups of the two rates LAD should not overlap.
- Other financial or payment suggestion to ensure the milestone
	- Set up a milestone payment mechanism such that a portion of the payment will only be released upon the achievement of the milestone. If the milestone date is missed, the release of that portion will be deferred until achievement.
	- A more stringent version is to release upon the achievement of the milestone by the specified milestone date. If the milestone date is missed, that portion will not be released. However, that portion must eventually be released at some later specified stage (e.g. completion of the whole of the Works), otherwise, that portion of payment may be viewed as a penalty not enforceable.
	- An even more stringent method is to calculate that portion of payment based on the period of delay to the milestone until the milestone is achieved. Similarly, the amount shall be released later, but can be used to set off any LAD imposable upon delayed completion of the whole of the Main Contract Works.
	- The above assumes that the portion of payment is part of the original Contract Sum but released subject to conditions. Instead of delaying the release, the opposite is to offer incentive payment on top of the original Contract Sum for on-time achievement of the milestone date with full or very limited grounds for EOT.
	- Bonus: in all the above cases, Architect will have to certify the achievement or non-achievement of the milestones.
- Construction programme becomes contractually binding
	- We can, but we normally do not do so. If we do so, we would need to consider which parts of which programme should be contractually binding, the consequences of failing to comply with the contractual parts, extra administrative works required to monitor the changes to the contractual parts, the time delay to agree on changes to those contractual parts, and that to agree on the responsibilities. The normal practice may be sufficient.
	- Tender documents will need to specify possession, commencement and completion dates for the whole or specified parts of the site or the works. These dates are contractually binding upon both parties. Any changes will have consequential implications leading ultimately to delay damages and loss and expense compensation, depending on the respective parties' responsibilities. These rates need to be properly reflected on the preliminary programme submitted with the tender and in the master programme submitted in the post contract stage. Therefore, such information on the programme is contractual binding.
	- Other activities and milestone will also be shown on the programmes.
	- The preliminary programmes submitted with the tenders are meant to demonstrate the tenderer's understanding of the tender requirements for the purpose of tender appraisal, and are usually not specified to form part of the Contract because Consultants would not spend time to check the correctness of all the activities and milestones.
	- Contractors are usually required to submit master programmes soon after the award of the Contract, and the Consultants will comment on the programmes in greater detail. Though the information shown on the master programmes is not declared to be contractually binding, it is of great significance for monitoring the progress of the works and for assessment of delays and EOT.
	- Unless otherwise specified in the contracts, the contractors are always free to decide the method, manner and sequence to carry out the works. Therefore, they can adjust their programme to suit their needs but shall bear the consequence.
	- If it is intended to make the preliminary programme or the master programme contractually binding, the first thing to decide would be which parts of the programme are contractually binding and effects of failing to comply with the binding information. This would apply to both parties, not just the Contractor. Contractually binding parts having no cost or time consequences in case of failure to comply would become meaningless.
	- Secondly, both parties must agree on those contractually binding parts and monitor any deviation afterwards.
	- Making the programmes contractually binding would have the following disadvantages:
		- It may take unacceptably long time to agree on the preliminary programme if it involves a lot of binding parts, to affect the award of the Contract
		- It will increase the post contract administration complexity to agree on the master programme, monitor any changes, and agree on the responsibilities for those changes, which may not add much value to the target of having the works completed by the completion date, and the delays in reaching agreements will actually cause overall project delays.
		- It will restrict the freedom of Contractor to plan and carry out the works, and the flexibility for the consultants to request revision
		- It may lead to more claims as inevitable deviations from the programmes may constitute a breach of contract or trigger variations. Arguments may arise over the causes, liabilities and responsibilities.
		- Contractor may price higher for the additional administrative works and risks in his tender
- Measures to control the Contractor's failure to submit programmes
	- Require tenderers to price for the preparation and submission of the master programme and its updates against a set of detailed quantities with descriptions of the scope and type of the programmes and the times for submission, which amounts shall be payable in interim payments and final payments only if the relevant submissions have been made. It should not be after the approval of the relevant submission because the submissions may happen before the payment valuation date while the approval may happen afterwards.
		- The quantities may be fixed or provisional. In case of EOT, the additional quantities shall be entitled to payment.
		- Such method does not guarantee good quality programmes.
		- It may also have a set of quantities related to the approval by the Architect, but this may be problematic leading to much less payment if the programmes are poor or the Architect is over-demanding or has constant changes.
	- Another method if to make a percentage deduction to the current payment valuation if the Architect certifies that the quantities or quality of the programmes submitted after the last payment valuation is not satisfactory. It should be stated whether and when such deduction will be released in the future. If the progress of the works is satisfactory or the Contractor has discharged his delay damages eventually, it would appear that such kind of deduction which may be more than the cost of the Contractor to submit the programmes in a satisfactory manner should be released to the Contractor.
		- Architect's certification of non-satisfaction may be challenged by the Contractor leading to tension in the on-going running of the project
	- Another method is to engage dedicated programme planner jointly approved by Contractor and Architect but paid out of the Contract Sum to prepare the programmes considering the ideas of the Contractor and the comments of the Architect.
		- This is not usually adopted because this requires full disclosure of the issues and hidden strategy of Contractor, and collaboration amongst all parties

## Question

You are the consultant QS for a proposed residential development in Kowloon. Two notices of delay and claim (“NOD&C”) have been served by the Contractor:

A)            NOD&C no. 8 — The Hong Kong Observatory had announced the Black Rainstorm Warning on 7 September 2023. Unfortunately, the Site suffered from serious flooding due to the rain after the cancellation of the Black Rainstorm Warning. The Contractor had to dewater the Site and rectify the damaged works. The Site could only resume to normal 5 days after the Black Rainstorm Warning.

B)            NOD&C no. 11 — The Contractor was instructed to comply with the Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work and Heat Stress at Work Warning (“Guidance Notes”) published by the Labour Department on 15 May 2023, the Contractor considered that a 15-minute rest break had to be provided after every 2 hours of hea\/y physical work. As a result, the Contractor considered he has suffered from delay and disruption to the completion of the Works.

In the notices, the Contractor asserted that:

A)                he is entitled to claim extension of time (“EOT”) of 5 days as stated in SFBC 2005/2006 clause 25.1(3)(c) for NOD&C no. _8_ [or GCC clause 50(1)(b)(iia)J; and

B)                 the newly published Guidance Notes were an additional requirement and should be deemed to be a variation under the Contract. Hence, he is entitled to EOT under SFBC 2005/2006 clause 25.1(3)(h) [or GCC clause 50(1)(b)(iv)] for NOD&C no. 11. The Contractor also notified that he had incurred loss of productivity at work.

Before responding to the Contractor, the Project Manager would like to have your advice after considering his opinion:

A.           NOD&C no. 8 - The Project Manager considers granting an EOT for only 1 day, gi\/en that the Black Rainstorm Warning was in effect for only 12 hours.

B.           NOD&C no. 11 - The Project Manager considers compliance with the Guidance Notes is not a \/ariation and no EOT is to be granted.

C.           The proper way for the Contractor to justify a claim for compensation for loss of productivity.

Please provide your advice in writing.

## Assessor Notes

- Black Rainstorm Warning
	- The hoisting of tropical cyclone warning signal No.8 or above or the announcement of a Black Rainstorm Warning is a listed event with EOT entitlement under clause 25.1(3)(c).
	- In general, the full direct effect of the listed events should be considered when granting EOT. However, in the present case, clause 25.1(3)(c) uses the words "hoisting ... Signal" and "announcement of ... Warning" instead of "No.8 tropical cyclone" or "Black Rainstorm". Those words would restrict the times of applications. Furthermore, clause 25.1(3)(b) permitting inclement weather conditions as a listed event has the phrase "and/or its consequence adversely affecting the progress of the Works." By comparison, while (b) permits the aftereffects, (c) does not permit similarly but restricts to the time of hoisting and announcement. Therefore, it is reasonable not to grant EOT for the 5 days after 7 September 2023.
	- However, the Contractor may consider to use clause 25.1(3)(b), which permits EOT for delays caused by "inclement weather conditions, being rainfall in excess of twenty millimetres in a twenty-four-hour period (midnight to midnight) ..., and its consequences adversely affecting the progress of the Works", because the Black Rainstorm should likely have caused the required amount of rainfall. Nevertheless, the Contractor should demonstrate how the Works were delayed to what extent by what kind of consequence effects.
	- Bonus: Contractor may consider to use clause 25.1(3)(e), which permits EOT for delays caused by "loss or damage caused by a Specified Peril". According to clause 1 interpretation and definitions, "flood" is one of the Specified Perils. It should be noted that when the scopes of two listed event descriptions overlap, an event listed in the specified one should be deemed excluded from the other more general one. For example, a Black Rainstorm can no longer be treated as a force majeure or a special circumstance also entitling to EOT. However, "flood" can narrowly escape that argument.
- Guidance Notes by Labour Department
	- The guidance notes are not mandatory statutory obligation but are guidance for discretionary use.
	- The Contractor was specifically instructed by Architect to comply with the Guidance Notes. If the compliance has resulted in any changes falling within the definition of Variation under clause 1.6, he is entitled to EOT under clause 25.1(3)(h) for delay caused by "an AI under clause 13.1 requiring a Variation"
	- The definition of Variation includes "..., the imposition of an obligation or restriction instructed by the Architect regarding ..., (vi) limitation of working hours; or (vi) the sequence of carrying our or completion work; or the addition or alteration to or omission of such obligations or restrictions imposed by the Contract", and should be wide enough to cover the present case.
	- The Contractor should demonstrate how the Works were delayed to what extent by compliance with the Guidance Notes over what he should have done to comply with the Statutory Requirements. Compliance with changing Statutory Requirements is not a listed event for EOT.
- Justification for a claim for compensation for loss of productivity
	- Loss of productivity is usually related to disruption and disturbance of the work activities and sequence. Without the disruption and disturbance, the work activities could have been proceeded as planned. With the disruption an disturbance, the amount of production of the originally assigned resources has decreased over the disrupted and disturbed period of time, thus requiring extra resources during and after the disrupted and disturbed period of time, and possibly causing delay to the overall programme.
	- In order to demonstrate the loss of productivity, Contract shall carry out and submit a disruption analysis for the works carried out. The analysis should aim to identify the changes in the resources and productivity over the relevant period of time to enable an understanding of the work activities involved and reasons for changes in the productivity. The Contractor should provide a set of endorsed and contemporaneous project records (e.g. site diary, labour records, manpower and resources plan, etc.) to substantiate the analysis
	- If the Contractor intends to claim the additional time and costs as a result of the loss of productivity, a calculation of the extra time and costs involved together with cause and effect explanation and supporting documents (e.g. labour, wages, labour records, etc.) should be provided.
	- The time and cost effects should be the difference between the disrupted situation as compared with the situation if there had been no disruption and disturbance, which may not necessarily be the same as the planned programme because the planned programme might not have been updated to reflect the latest situation before the disruption and disturbance
	- Instead of describing in general terms as the above, it is equally permissible for Candidates to give example illustration of items losing productivity, such as workers taking more rest times in a day, workers going to sheltered spaces, workers going more trips up and down the buildings, workers warming up after breaks, workers working overtime, workers needing time to take dinners because of overtime, productivity during overtime lowered, productivity working persistent long hours lowered even with more breaks, longer time to provide plant, additional refreshment and meal allowances (though not exactly a productivity issue by themselves), etc. In any case, it is important to demonstrate the extras over the situation in the absence of the disruption and/or disturbance.
	- Contractor owns the burden of proof on the loss of the productivity
	- Bonus: Candidates able to identify two main families of disruption analysis, namely the productivity-based approach (e.g. measured mile analysis, project-comparison studies etc.) and the cost-based approach (e.g. estimated and actual cost analysis, plant and labour analysis etc.)

## Question

You are the consultant QS for a project comprising high-rise residential buildings with a 33-month Contract Period. After you have completed the valuation for Interim Certificate No. 10, the Contractor's Project Manager sent you an email raising his concern about the cashflow and commented on the following items:

A.           In the Preliminaries bill, since not all items have been priced and the total Preliminaries price is relatiVely low (which is only 8’fo of the to1aI Contract Sum), 90% of the total Preliminaries price shall be paid in the early stage of the Contract to cover the costs incurred in such a stage, e.g., insurances and bonds, hoardings and covered walkways, site office.

B.           Although the electrical installation works have not been carried out on site, the preparation and submission of detailed shop drawings and installation drawings have started. The gross valuation of the work done for the design work shall be assessed e\/en when there is no separate design item in the Bills of Quantities.

C.           Method statement for the scaffolding works have been submitted. The gross valuation of the work done for the submission shall be assessed.

D.           ProVisional quantities haVe been allowed in the Bills of Quantities for all reinforcement bars. The QS shall value according to the total proVisiona! Quantities times the work done percentage on Site, and has no reason to make any adjustment to the total quantities before all detailed remeasurement has been completed.

Please draft an email to respond the Contractor.

## Assessor Notes

- Preliminary items
	- Preliminary items are usually priced as many lump sums. It is common that the Contractors do not enter a price against every preliminary item, but only against some major or cost significant items
	- Tender Documents usually contain a clause stipulating that in the absence of a price against any item, the price shall be deemed to be included elsewhere in the Tender Sum and hance the Contract Sum. This means that the valuations for payment can only be based on the prices expressly entered in BQ.
	- In any case, it is the Contractor's choice not to price against some items and price the total preliminaries low, which will result in lower amount of payment for the preliminaries. However, his rates for the measured works should have become higher to gain the possible benefits of higher rates for variation additions which are more common than variation omissions
	- SFBC clause 32.2(3)(c) states that the payment valuations shall include "the proportion of the value of a preliminary item properly provided or carried out by the Contractor where its value is included as a separate sum in the Contract Bills". The key words are "proportion of the value included as a separate sum"
		- Bonus: it is customary to split each value into different proportions representing the initial setup costs, time related running costs, work value related running costs and final removal costs, and pay the value according to the proportions provided or carried out.
		- Bonus: larger proportion will be paid for preliminary items with high initial costs like premia for insurances and bonds, erection of hoardings, covered walkways and site office. However, plant and machinery will be paid proportional to their costs of use whether brought or rented. Other preliminary items without high initial costs will be paid proportionally to their overall item spent or values of the related measured work done, e.g. costs of site staff, temporary water or electricity, etc. , with a proportion retained to be paid later for the final removal of the physical items
- Design work for electrical installation works
	- By SFBC clause 32.2(3)(a), the estimated amounts in Interim Certificate should include the estimated value of the permanent work properly carried out.
	- The design work is a part of the permanent work required to be carried out, and a reasonable proportion of the price for the permanent work for the design work done shall be reflected in the Interim Certificate, even when there is no separate design item in BQ.
	- If there is a separate item priced in the preliminaries or elsewhere for such design work, the value of design work done shall be paid proportionally to that price, with no duplication with the price for the permanent work.
	- Bonus: Although the Contractor has submitted the design, it is prudent to check whether the Engineer has commented or rejected or approved the design. Based on the principle that only permanent work properly carried out shall be included in the Interim Certificate, discount factor shall be reasonably applied if Engineer has not yet approved the design.
- Method statement for scaffolding works
	- SFBC clause 32.3(3)(b) states that the payment valuations shall include "the proportion of the value of temporary works properly carried out where their value is included as a separate sum in the Contract Bills". 
	- Scaffolding works are temporary works which shall be paid if the value is included as a separate sum in the Contract Bills whether in the preliminaries or elsewhere.
	- Preparation and submission of the method statement for the scaffolding works are parts of the scaffolding works and a reasonable proportion shall be included in the gross valuation to the extent of them being properly done.
	- However, if there is no separate item priced for scaffolding, it is presumed that the cost has been included in the unit rates for the relevant permanent work, e.g. cladding or tiling for which scaffolding is used. In this case, the value of scaffolding which is a piece of temporary works, shall not be valued in the Interim Payment, but shall be valued as part of the relevant permanent work in accordance with the work done progress of the permanent work.
- Provisional quantities for rebar
	- All provisional quantities are subject to remeasurement under the Contract, based on the latest drawings issued under instruction
	- The remeasurement of provisional quantities takes time, especially for all reinforcement bars
	- It is common for the remeasurement of reinforcement to be completed only at the later stage of the Contract
	- However, as stated above, the estimated amount in Interim Certificate should include the estimated values of the permanent work properly carried out under SFBC. These values shall be based on the actual quantities done inclusive of variations whether or not the contract quantities are firm or provisional, remeasured or not
	- If there are differences between the provisional quantities and the quantities measured or estimated from the latest instruction drawings, whether increase or decrease, the quantities so measured or estimated should be used in lieu of the provisional quantities when estimating the proportion of the actual quantities done on site and to be included in the payment valuations
	- It is common for QS to allow for more in the provisional quantities and therefore make a discount when using the total value to value the work done, but the reasonableness of the discounted total should be demonstrated to the Contract by sampled measurement of the steel ratios or progressive remeasurements before completed remeasurement
	- The total quantities of reinforcement bars delivered to site should serve as a good indication of the quantities fixed after subtracting the quantities not yet fixed, the quantities used for wastage, deemed to include spacers, and bards used elsewhere such as in temporary railing, rails, fencing, etc.

## Question

You are the consultant QS for an improvement project in the construction stage. The Contract is a traditional lump sum contract. The Completion Date of the Works is 2 months later, however, at the site meeting last week, the Contractor reported that he is going to complete the Works by this month, that is about 1 month earlier than the Completion Date.

After the meeting, the Project Manager has raised his concern and said the Employer is not ready to take over the Works before the Completion Date. He asked the Architect to issue the Substantial Completion Certificate for the Works only on or after the Completion Date.

Please write to advise the Project Manager and the Architect on the following:

A.        Is the Employer allowed under the Contract to refuse to take over the Works which have been completed before the Completion Date?

B.        What are the contractual implications to all and practical implications to the Employer if the Contractor completes the Works before the Completion Date?

[12 marks]

## Assessor Notes

- Refusal to take over upon completion before Completion Date
	- By SFBC clause 23.2, Contractor is obliged to carry out and completion the Works on or before the Completion Date, but there is no contract provision requiring the Contractor to keep the Works until the Completion Date. In other words, the Contractor is allowed to complete the Works before the Completion Date and hand over the Works to the Employer. "Completion Date" includes "extended Completion Date" or "Date for Completion" or "Time for Completion"
	- SFBC does not have an express provision for Employer to take over the Works upon completion of the Works, but clause 2.1(1)(h), the Contractor's responsibility for the care of the Works shall end upon 14 days after Substantial Completion of the Works. This means that the Employer should take over within these 14 days.
- Contractual implications to all and practical implication to Employer
	- Completion of the Works means substantial completion under SFBC
	- Clause 1 defines Substantial Completion to mean the state of completion where the Works have been substantially completed to the Architect's satisfaction, have passed the required inspection and tests, may not absolutely completed or entirely free from defects, but can be taken over and used by Employer for their intended purpose, without unreasonable interreference or interruption by the completion of outstanding work or rectification of the defects.
	- It is the responsibility of the Architect to issue the Substantial Completion Certificate under SFBC clause 17.1 when the above conditions are fulfilled. He may attach or issue separately a list of outstanding work and defects notifying the Contractor to complete or even requiring an undertaking from the Contractor to complete with or without times specified.
	- The Contractor's liability for LAD for delayed completion ceases to run upon the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate
	- Soon after the issuance of the Substantial Completion Certificate, the Employer should take over the Works noting that the Contractor's responsibility for the care of the Works will end upon 14 days under clause 2.1(h). The insurance cover for the loss or damage to the Works, if taken out by the Contract, will also cease at the same time. If the Employer fails to take over beyond those 14 days, he should be liable for the care and insurance of the Works.
	- The Contractor has an implied duty to clear away and leave the site.
	- DLP starts to run after Substantial Completion
	- The period for completion of final account starts to run after Substantial Completion
	- Half of retention shall be released
	- If surety bond is required and is to expire upon Substantial Completion, it shall be released 
	- Instead of regular monthly certificates, interim payment certificate shall only be issued when further amounts are due to the Contractor under clause 32.1(3)
	- The above are applicable whether the completion is earlier or later than the Substantial Completion Date because all of them are hinged on the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate
	- Specific practical implication to the Employer related to completion earlier than the Completion Date include:
		- Arrangement for inspection earlier than planned
		- Arrangement for operational training earlier than planned
		- Mobilization of building management staff earlier than planned
		- Marketing and advertising for sales or rental earlier than planned
		- Changing the agreed sales handover dates or rental start dates
		- Moving in earlier than planned
		- Releasing retention earlier than planned
		- Financial burden in connection with the above
