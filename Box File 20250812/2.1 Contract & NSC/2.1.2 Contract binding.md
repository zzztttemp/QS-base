### Spec v LOA - waive claim for possession postponement *(2018 D2Q3a)*

- Bonus: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Spec clause is imprecise</mark>. A date "as stated elsewhere in the Contract" can mean <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a date as stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents</mark> which will become part of the Contract or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a date as to be stated elsewhere in the Contract eventually constituted</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Normally</mark>, this kind of clause would say that the possession date of the site as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents</mark> is for indication only. The date will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to confirmation</mark> upon the award of the Contract or by means of an Architect's Instruction after the award of the Contract. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No monetary claim will be entertained if the confirmed date is not later than a certain date</mark>. This would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">give a limited period for the Contractor to take the risk</mark> of a non-definite possession date.
- The possession date of the site has been <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">confirmed in the Employer's LOA</mark> with no similar stipulation that this is still indicative. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LOA is the concluding document conforming the offer and acceptance process and shall take precedence</mark> over the Particular Specification. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no claim intention</mark> should apply if the actual possession date is within the one month as confirmed in the LOA, but would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not apply to the period beyond</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Employer may argue</mark> that Spec clause is wide enough to refer to the date as stated in LOA as indicative only subject to further adjustment. This argument would appear to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">weak</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that Spec clause is of no effect at all as it intends to override the Conditions of Contract which permit L&E compensation for delayed possession date but <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">CC should take precedence</mark>. The chance of success would depend on express term of CC used. It is common practice to state in Tender Documents some modification to the standard terms of CC. In the absence of express terms in the Contract to deny the effect, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">modification stated in Spec is explicit and cannot be totally ignored</mark>. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no claim period stated in Spec should be valid, when being read in conjunction with the confirmed date as stated in LOA</mark>
- Contractor may also argue that there is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">no definite period for him to take the risk</mark>. In the absence of a definite period, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender validity period may serve as a useful limit</mark>. The Contract is supposed to be awarded within the tender validity period for immediate commencement after on or two weeks' notice. The no claim period can reasonably be interpreted as no later than the end of such notice period but not beyond. It is considered that this is the best approach to operate Spec clause.
- The final defense available to the Contractor would be to see whether the Contract contains provision for him to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">determine</mark> his employment or terminate the Contract if the delay to site possession is exceeding a certain permissible maximum period
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC provision</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cl.5.1</mark> means that CC take precedence over Spec, but LOA takes precedence over CC unless modified later in Appendix upon formal signing of Contract
	- In this circumstance, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">one month stated in LOA is the period of waiver of monetary claim</mark>
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.36.1</mark> authorizes Contractor to service notice of default leading to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determination</mark> of employment if the possession date is delayed by more than 120 days
## Discrepancy in Documents

- Contractor to inform Architect (cl.2.4(1))
- Architect based on precedence order of Contract Doc (5.1(1),(2))
- Architect to issue AI to resolve (cl.2.4(2)) - VO, EOT, LE

### Dwg have but Spec not *(2016 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Scope of works</mark>
	- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lump sum without quantities</mark>, the work included in the original contract sum shall cover those shown on the Contract Drawings and described in the Specification.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SP can only give a broad description</mark> of the scope of works and cannot list out each and every single item of work. The Contract Documents shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">read as a whole and taken to be mutually explanatory</mark>.
	- The symbol of sump pump on the Contract Drawings is not part of the standard legend usually give on drawings but was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specificlly marked</mark> inside the sump pit with the capacity of the sump pump indicated. It should be sufficient to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">indicate the intention</mark> that a sump pump should be provided.
	- Sump pits by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common understanding</mark> should be equipped wit sump pumps. There is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no provision for NSC</mark> for pumping services. An <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">average competent building contractor should have</mark> realized the need to include the sump pump in the scope of works and the tender sum. The fact that there are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rate and sum in SOR</mark> indicates that the Contractor has the same understanding. Therefore, a reasonable conclusion should be that a sump pump of the indicated capacity was included in the scope of the works.
	- Although <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Technical Specification contians no other information</mark> about the technical detials and requirements of the sump pump, the sump pump is to be selected by the Contractor and should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fit for purpose</mark>. "Fit for purpose" does not mean the best. The Architect canont impose excessive requirements.
	- It may be argued that apart from the sump pump itself, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">associated electrical work and control panels were not shown</mark> on the Contract Drawings or specifically priced in SOR and were therefore excluded. Without the associated electrical work and control panels, the sump pump cannot operate. Adopting the same test described for the sump pump above, it is reasonable to conclude when pricing for a sump pump, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costs of the associated</mark> electrical work and control panels being the indispensable ancillaries <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">should also be considered</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Ambiguities or discrepancies</mark>
	- The Contractor should immediately <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inform</mark> the Architect if he finds any amibuities or discrepancies within or between Contract Drawings and Specification.
	- The Architect should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarify</mark> any ambiguities or discrepancies and inform the Contractor.
	- In case of discrepancies, the Architect should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determine</mark>, basing on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">order of precedence of the Contract Documents</mark>, what should be deemed to have been included in the Contract Sum.
	- The Architect should clarify what he now really wants.
	- SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.4(1), 5.1(1), 5.1(2)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Use rate for VO</mark>
	- Since this is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lump sum contract based on Drawings and Specification</mark>, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantities</mark> in SOR do not form part of the contract, but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unit rates</mark> do form and can be used for pricing variations. 
	- Hence, the quantity of the sump pump in SOR cannot be deemed to be the quantity included in the Contract Sum. 
	- On the other hand, if it is concluded that the scope of works did not include the sump pump, its unit rate can still be used when a sump pump of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same capacity</mark> is added back.

## Practice

- Composition
	- Complete Articles of Agreement
	- GCC reflects amendments of SCC
	- Appendix, calculate completion date, limit of retention, amount of surety bond
	- If tender sum differs from the awarded contract sum, add a remarked in FOT & SOT and a built-up in LOA
	- Adjustment factor for arithmetical error and discount
	- Correspondence bound as contract correspondence
	- A second volume if a great number of pages
- Administration
	- Number of copies
		- A least two sets: original & duplicate; might need certified true copy
		- Any need for certified true copies
	- Signature
		- Articles of Agreement
		- Contract Drawings
	- Under seal
		- Deed - 12 years limitation period
		- Signed by the person who is to be bound, and the signature must be attested by a witness
		- Check Contractor's Articles of Memorandum and Articles of Association to ensure in accordance
	- Under hand
		- Simple contract - 6 years limitation period
- Backdating
	- May constitute fraud
	- Preferable to state the a contract is to have retrospective effect from a particular date

## Special Scenario

### FOT w qualification not physically bound *(2003 Q3.1)*

- Core issues
	- A document not physically bound into the Contract Documents may still be considered as a contractually <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">binding</mark> part of the Contract <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">if valid reference is made</mark> to it by those forming part of the Contract Documents
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Investigations</mark> should be carried out to see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether</mark> the special payment term or the FOT has been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specifically excluded</mark> one way or other to the effect of voiding any interpretation that the special payment term is still valid
	- Depending on the possible findings, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">different conclusions</mark> can be drawn
- Additional points
	- While it is not welcome by Consultants that a special term be inserted by tenderers in FOT, such insertion cannot be ignored or deemed to be void since the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">FOT, representing the offer</mark>, is the most significant part of the returned tender. In the absence of express rejection of such a special term in the subsequent chain of tender correspondence up to LOA, it should, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">after award of the Contract, be deemed to have been accepted</mark>
	- On the other hand, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a document not physically bound into the Contract Documents is usually treated as not forming part of the Contract</mark>. However, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">if it is referred to</mark> by those forming part of the Contract, it may be regarded as having contractual effect by reference, for example, a reference to the British Standard
	- In the present case, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">onus should be on the Contractor to prove</mark> that such reference exists and the physical absence of FOT from Contract Documents was a common <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mistake which should be rectified</mark>
	- Investigation must therefore be made to see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">why the FOT was not included</mark>
	- The possible investigations and implications include:
		- Check Contract Documents to see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether FOT has been specifically excluded or superseded</mark> in its entirety from forming part of the Contract - the special payment term is void if FOT has been specifically excluded
		- Check Contract Documents to see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the special payment term has been specifically rejected</mark> or impliedly superseded by another subsequent set of payment terms - the special payment term is void if a subsequent set of payment terms has been agreed
		- Check the Contract Documents to see whether there is any specific reference (e.g. listed in LOA) or implied link to the FOT and whether such reference or link is unbroken until the contract signing - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if an unbroken chain of reference or link exists</mark>, then it is highly likely that there was no <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">consensus between the contract parties</mark>, except by the act of signing the contract, that the special payment term is no longer valid
		- Check files and people who were involved in the tender negotiation, tender award and contract documentation to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">recall reasons for non-inclusion of FOT </mark>- if there is a clear evidence that the non-inclusion of the FOT was intentional to the knowledge of the Contractor, then the special payment term cannot be entertained
		- Check whether there are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">collateral agreements</mark> in connection with the special payment term

### Mode of contract execution (2004 Q4Bii)

- The wording as quoted are used for execution of a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">simple contract</mark>, a contract which is not executed as a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">deed</mark> (i.e. not under seal). The contract execution will usually be witnessed to signify the authenticity of the persons signing the contract
- The other mode of contract execution is a contract under seal (a specialty contract).
- Under Chapter 347 Limitation Ordinance, actions founded on simple contract are subject to a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limitation period of 6 years</mark> from the date on which the cause of action accrued. This includes one contracting party's legal action against the other defaulting party for damages as a result of breach of contract. For a specialty contract or a sealed contract, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limitation period is 12 years</mark>.
- Usually, C will look upon a sealed contract as carrying a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">heavier liability</mark> upon them owing to the longer exposure to the other party's action, and therefore, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher price</mark> theoretically.
- Furthermore the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procedural complexity</mark> of executing a sealed contract in certain corporations may deter the use of such form
- For A&A works arranged by IO for the estate, to maximize the protection to the owners of the estate, a sealed contract may be more desirable

### Checklist for binding contract as deed (2004 Q4Biii)

- Checking is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">to establish the legal capacity of the signatories</mark>, so that the contract when executed is legally binding and enforceable
- For parties executing the contract as a deed, the following documents should be checked:
	- For a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sole proprietor, or unincorporated body</mark>, the person or the partners of the unincorporated body should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">all sign and a red circular sticker or wafer</mark> (replacing the previous was + seal) should be affixed beside the signatures.
	- For a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">body corporate</mark>, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">company memorandum should be checked</mark> to identify the specified manner for executing a deed. Usually the body corporate will resolve to have a deed executed by the affixation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the company's common seal or corporate seal, plus the signature and/or the witnessing</mark> of execution by the authorized signatories in accordance with the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Articles of Association</mark> or other constructional documents of the parties. There would usually be a Board Meeting approving the execution of the agreement. Hence, to ensure the legal capacity of the signatories and the effectiveness of the execution, the company memorandum, the Articles of Association and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Board Resolution</mark> must be checked.
	- The body corporate may also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">authorize a Power of Attorney to execute</mark> a deed. This is usually the case if the body corporate is incorporated overseas. In this case, the Power of Attorney should be carefully checked to authenticate the authority of the signatory

### Signed Contract Deviate from LOA

- General rule
	- LOA together with tender & correspondence constitute a binding contract unless and until a formal contract is executed
	- The conditions in formal contract shall supersede those in LOA
- Need to investigate the reason, any mistake, what is the true intention of parties

### Programme not Binding

- A flexible document not binding to Contract
- Allow changing and update
- Impractical to comply without revision

### Backdate AA date *(2022 D1Q2a)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Date of Articles of Agreement</mark>
	- The date to be put on the Articles of Agreement should be the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">date when both parties meet to sign on the formal contract</mark>. However, if the parties do not meet but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sign on different days, then either the date of signing by the first party or the date of signing by the second party should be used</mark>. The date to be used is not of very great contractual significance because when the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">letter of award was signed, a binding contract</mark> was formed on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"offer and acceptance"</mark> basis being the Contractor's offer based on Tender Documents and the tender correspondence accepted by Employer. The parties can then exercise their contractual rights and obligations whether or not the formal contract is signed. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Backdating is therefore unnecessary</mark>. On the other hand, the date of signing may be of significance in other business outside the Contract. Therefore, backdating is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not a good practice</mark> because it effectively states a date that is false and should be avoided.
	- Bonus: In the absence of an agreed consolidated set of Contract Documents, the<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> contract administration may become cumbersome</mark>. That may cause confusion and even arguments over what should or should not be included in the Contract Documents. If there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">argument</mark> between the parties developed before the Contract is signed, one party or both parties may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">refuse to sign</mark> the Contract until the argument is settled. Therefore, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advisable</mark> to give a full list of the documents to be included in the Contract Documents and sign the Contract as soon as possible.

### COT not binding *(2022 D1Q2b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Instructions to Tenderers</mark>
	- The Instructions to Tenderers are essentially rules <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">governing the procedures during the tender and award stage</mark>. They are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not supposed to govern the post contract management</mark>. They should not contain any contract terms and conditions. Under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC clause 5.1</mark>, the Instructions to Tenderer are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not listed</mark> as one of the documents forming part of the Contract. However, it is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">normal practice</mark> to include all the documents included in the Tender Documents in the Contract Documents to serve as a complete set of record of documents issued for tendering in case references have been made to them in the tender correspondence, but it does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not mean that each such document will form part of the Contract</mark> (i.e., having contractual effects) 
	- However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">some consultants do include provisions</mark> in or attachments (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">e.g. declarations or undertakings in relation to confidentiality, conflict of interest, integrity, track records, which should have been done elsewhere</mark>) to the Instructions of Tender to govern the procedures and conduct after the award of the Contract. In that case, the Instruction to Tenderers should form part of the Contract and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">should be included</mark> in the Contract Documents.
	- Bonus: the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Instructions to Tenderer</mark> usually tell the tenderer what are issued to him, what the tenderer shall submit with his tender, how his tender will be assessed, rules regarding adjustment of arithmetical errors, discounts, etc.

### Missing spec page in tender submission *(2022 D1Q2c)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Missing page</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Instruction to Tenderer</mark> usually require the tenderer to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">check the completeness</mark> of the Tender Documents against the contents page, and also specify that the tenderer is not allowed to make unauthorised alteration to the Tender Documents. As the question says, the Contractor has confirmed receipt of the Tender Documents. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Form of Tender</mark> usually requires the tenderer to declare that his tender is submitted with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">full examination of all Tender Documents</mark>. The Form of Tender also usually contains a statement that the tender is based on the Tender Documents. Therefore, that missing specification page is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clerical mistake</mark> in the Contractor's submission and shall be rectified by inclusion in the Contract Documents for execution. 
	- Bonus: Some tenderers chop every page of the returned Tender Documents. If the Contractor has done so, he should be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">chop the missing page</mark> as well for binding into the Contract Documents

### Programme binding (2024 D1Q3)
