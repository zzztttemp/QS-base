## Forming Sub-Contract

- NSC are nominated by Architect to carry out certain part of works including specialist works, or supply certain materials
- Nomination
	- PC Sum / Pro Sum / Variation / agreement + AI (cl.29.1(1))
	- MC's right of reasonable objection (cl.29.2)
		- Good reason: safety, finance, unreasonable low tender, unreasonable programme (cl.29.2(1))
		- Time frame (cl.29.2(3))
		- Architect to decide (cl.29.2(5))
		- If Architect refuse to withdraw, still (cl.29.2(6))
		- Delay by NSC for objection ground (cl.29.2(7))
			- EOT (cl.25.1(3)(n))
			- L&E (cl.27.1(h))
		- Rationale: If the NSC fails to perform, MC would take up the consequence
	- MC to enter into Sub-Contract with NSC
- Re-nomination (cl.29.13)
	- Due to MC's default, MC bear cost
	- Due to other reason, re-nominated asap, entitle EOT and L&E
- Award NSC before MC
	- By novation (see 1.3.3)
	- Or expressly state in contract 
- Relationship
	- Contract between MC and NSC (cl.29.5)
	- Employer not liable to NSC (cl.29.14)
	- Employer in full control of selecting NSC, and settle F/A with NSC directly
	- MC is responsible for the works of NSC other than design work (cl.29.6)
	- A collateral warranty linked between Employer & NSC in order to create a privity for further claims & disputes (cl.29.3) (see 2.2.3)
- Terms of NSC should be consistent with MC - back to back
- Adjustment of PC Sum & Pro Sum
	- Adjust based on actual NSC contract sum
	- No adjustment for attendance
	- Adjustment profit based on pre-agreed percentage
- Attendance from MC to NSC
	- Scaffolding, hoarding, hoisting, temporary road

### Privity & Chain of Responsibility *(2015 D1Q4)*

- Signing
	- Despite the fact that NSC is nominated by E, NSC is employed by MC. Sub-Contract is to be signed between and by the two contract parties only, being <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC and NSC</mark>. There is no direct contractual link (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">privity of contract</mark>) between E and NSC. E is not a party to Sub-Contract. Therefore, E is not required to sign on the attestation page of NSC. If he likes, he can sign as a witness but this does not add anything to his rights.
- Safeguarding
	- In the absence of a privity of contract between E and NSC, E would not be able to sue NSC for any action or inaction in connection with the Sub-Contract Works. However, NSC works are deemed to be part of MC works. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">MC</mark> works are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">governed by Main Contract</mark> between E and MC. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC is accountable to E for the performance of NSC</mark> in carrying out NSC works. Therefore, E is protected. The forgoing principle has been handled by most standard forms. In the day to day running of project, NSC will often have direct dialogues with consultants and PM while observing the formal channel of communication.
	- Some <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">exception to this chain of responsibility</mark> would be MC will not be responsible for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NSC's design responsibility</mark> and MC will not be responsible to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">find a replacement</mark> NSC in case the original NSC is determined. To cover the gap, NSC are often required to provide E with a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Form of Warranty</mark> guaranteeing the due performance of NSC including design, selection of materials, and on time completion, etc. And a requirement to provide a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">surety bond to E</mark>.

### Award NSC before MC *(2015 D1Q4)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Rationale</mark>
	- Signing the Sub-Contract with NSC first would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure a binding contract</mark> between E and NSC. Both E and NSC will have greater <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">assurance of the sustainability</mark> of the Sub-Contract. NSC can start <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ordering long lead item</mark> especially MEP equipment. It is a direct contract for the time being.
	- Subsequently transferring to MC will be able to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relieve E from the bounds</mark> of the Sub-Contract.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Approach</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Assignment may not be the appropriate</mark> approach in the circumstances because assignment of the obligations under a contract is much more difficult than assignment of the rights under the contract. A simple assignment by E to MC with the knowledge of NSC will be able to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">transfer only rights but not obligations</mark>. Without a complete assignment of both rights and obligations with the consent of all three parties involved, some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">privity of contract still exists between E and NSC</mark>, and the Employer's obligations cannot be released.
	- When <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">all three parties' consents</mark> are required in any case. A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">novation</mark> agreement is a tri-partite agreement of the three involved parties, through which E drops out from NSC and is substituted by MC. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">All rights and obligations</mark> of E are novated to MC, and MC replace E as the party of Sub-Contract.
	- To address the possibility of objection by MC of nomination of a particular sub-con, and as a more flexible alternative, it is also common for E to issue a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Letter of Intent</mark> only to NSC stipulating that there is an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">intention to E to nominate NSC subject to the acceptance by MC</mark> and there is no mutual liability if the nomination is not accepted by MC.
		- A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">drawback</mark> if that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">E is not bound to nominate and NSC is not bound to stay with his tender</mark>. Without any assurance, NSC would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not start work before acceptance</mark> by MC.
		- LOI may go further to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">stipulate</mark> that there is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">temporarily binding contract</mark> apart from an intention to nominate whereby:
			- NSC shall proceed with Sub-Contract Works in the interim and will get paid by Employer, so as to get the work started
			- If MC accepts NSC, it will be deemed that MC had issued the LOI to NSC in place of E from the beginning, so as to relieve the Employer
			- In case of valid objection by MC, the obligation to nominate will cease, and NSC shall have no claim except for the payment of work done, so as to provide freedom for the Employer to switch

### MC's in-house rule on NSC (2005 Q1C)

- Memo of company's position
	- NSC is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obliged to comply with the terms and conditions of Nominated Sub-Contract</mark> for which he has submitted a tender to E
	- NSC however is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not obliged to comply with any requirements on top</mark> of and in addition to those stipulated in Sub-Contract tender document
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Unless NSC agrees</mark> to include the additional requirements, MC cannot force NSC to incorporate such terms and conditions into Sub-Contract
	- If such term and conditions are added, NSC may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">incur extra costs</mark> which would expose him financially
	- In respect of the fines to be imposed for infringement of the stipulated conditions, the candidate should be able to discuss the enforceability of such in law, as these could well be interpreted as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">penalties</mark>, they being not commensurable 相稱 with the loss / damage flowing from non-compliance.
	- MC has the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">right to reject nomination</mark> under main contract. However, the disagreement of NSC to accept additional imposed terms by MC will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be a ground</mark> for his exercising such rejection. 
	- Until MC accepts the Architect's nomination, there is still no binding contract between MC and NSC. There is still the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fall back situation not to enter into NSC</mark>, depending on the explicit wording of the NSC tender form.
	- Any adverse effect on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relationship with MC</mark>
- Letter to MC
	- On the one hand uphold company's position and on the other hand be written in a tactful way so as not to sour the relationship with future MC
	- "We value our relationship with the MC and look forward to a productive and collaborative working relationship. We are open to further discussions to address any concerns and ensure a smooth project execution."

### MC's objection of NSC *(2011 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Introduction / background</mark>
	- The key issues of the disputed matters shall be identified
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Purpose of the report</mark>
	- Advise the contractual positions of the E & MC, and the ways to solve the discrepancies between the terms and conditions of the proposed NSC and MC
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual position of E & MC</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Generally</mark>
		- If there is a PC Sum in the Contract for Lift Installation, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect is empowered</mark> to issue an instruction to nominate NSC (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.29.1</mark>)
		- However, Architect should not nominated if the terms and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">conditions of the NSC deviate</mark> from the known terms and conditions
			- SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.5(2)</mark> stipulates that if the terms and conditions of NSC are different from those made known to the MC during his tendering, then the difference should be treated as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Variation</mark>
			- If MC does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not raise objection</mark> at the time of nomination, he is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deemed to have accepted</mark> any deviations from the defined terms and conditions
		- If there is no deviation from the known items and conditions, MC can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">still make reasonable objections</mark> under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(1)</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Big difference between NSC Sum and PC Sum</mark>
		- If MC argues that he is afraid that the NSC Sum is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">too low</mark> to be feasible, and this appears so when compared with other tenderers' prices, then this would be a valid ground for objection under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.1(1)(c)</mark>. If the NSC fails to perform, MC would take up the consequence unless and until there is a re-nomination. However, this is not the argument being adopted by MC. He is arguing against the profit becoming too low.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Profits</mark> priced in the Contract Sum on PC Sum should be recalculated <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on the same profit percentage</mark> but on the final NSC Sum (cl.32.7(2)(a) & (3)(d)). This would mean a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">significant reduction in profit</mark> in the present case. 
			- It may be argued that since the above rules for adjusting MC's profit on the PC Sum have been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clearly set out in the Contract</mark>, and a different between PC Sum and the NSC Sum should be expected and should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be a ground</mark> for the MC to objection to the nomination.
			- On the other hand, the difference between PC Sum and the NSC Sum is very significant and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may be regarded as beyond the normal range of differences</mark>. The total profit that the MC expected has been much reduced.
			- However, the significant difference may still exist if other lift companies are nominated. This issue is not specific to the company being nominated and has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nothing to do with his capability</mark>. It would therefore not be reasonable for MC to use this as a valid reason for objection.
		- The Archi should reply to MC that this objection to nomination is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not valid</mark>.
		- The significant difference could be handled separately, taking into account whether the effect may be counter-balanced by other NSC Sum being greater than the PC Sum.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Different payment terms between NSC and MC</mark>
		- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not important the MC's own payment terms are different</mark> from NSC's payment terms. Whether the NSC's payment terms are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">consistent with those made known to the MC during his tendering</mark> is more important. 
		- SFBC adopts the monthly progress payment method, the stage payment method would appear to be inconsistent with this, and should have been made known to MC during his tendering
		- If there is any inconsistency not made known to MC, he may make objection, but it should be noted that the standard form of main contract adopts a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pay-when-paid </mark>system where MC would only need to pay NSC after he himself receives the payment from Employer. Therefore, so long as MC does not have to pay before he himself receives the payment, even though a monthly progress payment method is changed to a stage payment method, he would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">have no loss or liability requiring compensation</mark>.
		- Therefore, an objection due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inconsistency would not be strong enough to reject the nomination</mark> but would only serve the purpose of clarifying any doubt or registering a claim for the compensation if the doubt is proven
		- The solution should be to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarify</mark> in writing beyond doubt that the pay-when-paid arrangement is still in place, and the timing of stage payments should follow the regular monthly intervals, though the values are based on the agreed staged percentages.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Different rates of LAD between NSC and MC</mark>
		- The rate of LAD stipulates in MC is HK $100,000/day. However, the rate of LAD in NSC is HK$10,000/day.
		- If MC accepts the two different rates of LAD, he would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exposed to the difference if there is any delay caused by the NSC</mark> which would not entitle MC to EOT. Therefore, it would be reasonable for MC to raise objection.
		- This is a case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviation from the known terms</mark>, SFBC would treat this as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark>. 
		- The solution should be to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarify</mark> in writing that MC's liability for LAD would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limited to HK$10,000/day</mark> in case of any delay that is solely due to the default of NSC.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Late delivery of lift equipment</mark>
		- If NSC's submitted preliminary programme is not compatible with MC's programme, it is reasonable for MC to seek clarification.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.29.2(1)(d)</mark> accepts this as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valid ground for objection</mark>.
		- It should be clarified and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">negotiated as necessary with NSC</mark> to deliver the lift equipment 1 months earlier or to shorten the installation, testing and commissioning period so as to suit MC's programme, possibly at some additional costs if his required longer times have not been cancelled.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Selecting the next tenderer</mark> meeting the shorter time is an option provided the letter of intent did not amount to a binding contractual commitment to keep the original NSC.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Negotiating with MC to accommodate</mark> the longer programme at some additional costs is another option
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Permitting an EOT with L&E</mark> would appear to be last and expensive resort.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Re-tendering would not be an option</mark> because the time lost would likely be more than 1 month delay now in question.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Making the lift installation as a direct contract or making it not essential to Substantial Completion</mark> would not be welcome by MC if this means losing a good opportunity to secure EOT.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible ways to solve</mark> the discrepancies between the terms and conditions of the proposed NSC and MC
	- Outline the possible way 
	- State the rationales and reasons for the recommendation
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Recommendation</mark>
	- Statement to recommend with back-up information and reasonable assumptions 

### MC's objection to NSC nomination *(2018 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">General</mark>
	- Under <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC</mark>, Contractor has the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">right to raise objection</mark> to AI requiring him to enter into NSC contract (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.1(1), (3)</mark>)
	- MC has made his objection to the nomination <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">within the time</mark> required under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(3)</mark>. It is for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect to decide</mark> whether the objection is valid (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(5)</mark>)
	- If the Architect considers the objection to be vaid, the Architect may withdraw the nomination instructino per <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(5)</mark>(a). Alternatively, Architect may invoke cl.29.2(5)(b) and refuse to withdraw the nomination instruction despite the valid objection with the caveat that Contractor will have the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">right to EOT cl.25.1(3)(n)</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E udner cl.27.1(2)(h)</mark> to the extent that the delay or disruption was atrributable to the grounds for objection raised by Contractor to nomination.

	- Under <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.1(1)(d)</mark>, MC can raise objection if programme is unreasonable. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Althought LON provides that no programme</mark> submitted by NSC during tender period should form part of the sub-contract, it <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cannot simply be assumed that NSC can revise it significantly</mark> to suit MC's master programme. Architect should be advised to take a reviwe of NSC's submission and convene a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">meeting with MC and NSC to resolve the apparent conflict</mark>. It may be possible that the delivery date as shown on MC master programme was not one of the essential or critical itme scrutinized by Architect when he approved the master programme, and that there <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">can still be some float time</mark> for chiller delivery. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC cannot unreasonably refuse adjustment</mark> to suit.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the conflict cannot be resolved</mark>, MC's objection should be considered valid. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Should Architect insist</mark> upon the nomination notwithstanding the valid objection, MC is still <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obliged to enter into NSC</mark> under cl.29.2(6). In such circumstances, MC is entitled under Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT and L&E</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">NSC award sum lower than PC sum</mark>
	- Under SFBC, MC can raise objection if NSC's tender sum if not financially viable (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(1)(c)</mark>) or if NSC's is not financially capable (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.2(1)(c)</mark>).
	- The mere fact that NSC's tender sum (HK $45M) is 10% lower than the corresponding PC sum (HK$50M) cannot be a sufficient justification that the tender sum is not financially viable because the different can be caused by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">many reasons, e.g. an over estimate of PC sum, a change in scope or design</mark> ater the inclusion of PC sum in MC, or a very <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">competitive</mark> market, etc.  A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">10% deviation cannot be considered as abnormal</mark>.
	- Event if the tender sum is low, it is not an indication that NSC is not or will not be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financially capable</mark> to support it, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nor an infication</mark> that NSC is currently financially incapable.
	- NSC's tender prices and financial standing have been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">scrutinized during tender stage</mark> to be in reasonable order. MC's objection should therefore not be accepted as valid, unless NSC can provide better evidence to prove his case. To be prident, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC's story should be heard to ensure that there is no insider information</mark> to be missed.
	- Depending on the final outcome, the nomination should <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">either be withdrawn or insisted</mark> upon in the same manner as mentioned above.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reduced profit</mark> due to the difference between the awarded NSC sum and PC sum shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be considered as a valid ground</mark> for objection to nomination.
	- If this if put forwarded as a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">claim for loss of profit</mark>, it is not admissible for various <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasons</mark>:
		- There has been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no guarantee</mark> that the awarded NSC sum must be very close to PC sum. 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Usually state in Contract</mark> that no monetary claim for adjustment of PC sum
		- PC sum serve as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">budgetary allowances and are usually set higher</mark>
		- A 10% difference is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not abnormal</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final NSC sum may become higher</mark> to narrow down the difference
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Some other NSC sum may be higher</mark> than PC sum to offset this particular difference
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Disparity of LAD due to NSC's qualification</mark>
	- It should be recalled and checked <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">whether NSC's tender qualification regarding LAD has been accepted</mark>. There must have been som good reasons to have accepted NSC's qualification. 
	- Under <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC NSC,</mark> the liability for delay damages are written in such a way that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NSC is liable to reimburse</mark> MC any loss and expense incurred by MC and any LAD imposed by Employer upon MC ude to the failure of NSC to complete on time under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.24.1 & 24.2</mark>.
	- If the LAD payable by NSC is not sufficient to cover MC's rate of LAD caused by NSC's delay, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC will suffer</mark>. The terms of sub-contract to be nominated must be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">consistent with those made known</mark> to MC during his tendering. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If such disparity is not made known to him during his tendering</mark>, MC's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">objection is valid.</mark> Unless the nomination is withdrawm or NSC agrees to withdraw the qaulification now, the disparity should be regarded as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">vaiation (cl.29.5(2))</mark>. Employer will have to bear the shortfall in recovery caused by the disparity.
