### Defective D&B item *(2016 D2Q1)*

- Due to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">poor workmanship</mark>
	- Contractor is liable, and Architect may, under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.8.3</mark> issue AI to Contractor requiring rectification of defective works. The Architect's approval of shop drawings is not relevant
- Due to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">inadequate design</mark>
	- The Contractor's responsibility will, under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.21.1(2)</mark>, be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limited to exercising reasonable skill and care</mark> unless the requirement of fitness for purpose is specifically stated.
	- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not</mark> apparent from contract drawings, BQ and specification that there is a requirement of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fitness for purpose</mark>. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect has to decide</mark> whether the Contractor has exercised reasonable skill and care.
	- It may be considered that even if there is no requirement of fitness for purpose, exercising reasonable skill and care should also take note of the humid environment of the indoor pool area. The Contractor should therefore be liable.
	- On the other hand, the Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">argue</mark> that the standard of reasonable skill and care should be that of the average competent professional design, he <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">has attained this standard,</mark> otherwise the shop drawings would not have been approved by the Architect. This is not contrary to the general rule that Architect's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approval of the shop drawings would not reduce</mark> Contractor's responsibility. It would therefore be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult for Architect to hold Contractor liable</mark>. The cost of rectifying defects will have to be borne by Employer. 
- Due to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">inappropriate selection of materials</mark>
	- It should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">further investigated</mark> whether the inappropriate materials are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">selected by the Contractor or Architect</mark>. 
	- Under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.8.1(2)</mark>, the materials selected by Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">must be fit for purpose</mark>. However, it should be noted that "materials selected by Contractor" referred to in the said clauses should not include the specified stainless steel, panels, and LED light.
