## General

- Cash flow forecast provides an anticipation of the likely payment though the contract period
- Purpose
	- Cash flow management 
		- Set up budget for each period
		- Make proper financial arrangement on time
		- Give early indication of cash conditions
		- If have bank loan, for bank's periodic inspection
		- To analyze time value of money in feasibility study and capital budgeting to appraise long-term project
	- Time management
		- Monitor work progress 
		- Early identification of possible delay
		- Adjust programme of work accordingly
- How the cash flow would affect the total budget, and what would a common method used to evaluate the relative merits of different cash flow patterns be? *(2013 D1Q3b)*
	- "Although the total estimated construction cost is known, since the expenditure would occur at different times, and would affect different interest rates for different periods. It would be necessary to calculate the financing charges. The cash flow projection would form the basis for such calculations. 
	- Furthermore, discounted cash flow calculations would be used to evaluate the relative merits of different cash flow patterns."

## Cashflow Forecast

- Cover letter, cash flow table, project title and date
- Statement to basis of cost and programme, and other qualifications
	- Basis: "The estimated cash flow table is based on the preliminary estimate No.X / financial statement No.X dated xxx and (preliminary) programme dated xxx"
	- Indication only: "The estimated cash flow table should be regarded as a rough indication of probable expenditure only and actual payments will depend on progress on site and delivery of materials"
- S-curve; or
	- Different for FDN / Building / E&M, should not use the same pattern
	- Assume 5% works after completion (e.g. assessment of pro qty / VO)
- Projection against programme when available
	- Breakdown the Contract Sum against the various elements in the construction programme
    - Spread out costs against respective activity months shown, some evenly distributed, some not
- Consideration
	- Time lag between work done and receipt of payment
	- Initial payment and set off of advance payment
	- Limit of retention and release upon SC & DLP
		- Possible first moiety release happen in month after SC
	- Terms of payment
	- Inclusion of possible EOT

##  S-Curve

- At pre-contract stage or when a construction programme is not available
- Different curve for different trade (FDN, BLD, E&M)
- S-curve not applicable
	- Contract with short period
	- Piling works; may simply assume the Contract Sum is equally spread during the contract period
	- Supply Contract
	- Kitchen Cabinet NSC, Soft Landscaping, Gondola
- Advantage
	- Save time and simple
	- Allow forecast at early stage without programme
- Disadvantages
	- Standard S-curve not for actual project
	- Large database required
	- Only suit for same type of project
	- Unavailable for company without data from past projects
	- Need to be renewed from time to time

## Reason for Incorrect Cash Flow and Improvement *(2001 Q 4.2)*

- Reasons for inaccuracy
	- Time
		- Programmes on which the forecasts are based usually are contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme not reflecting contractor's own delays </mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT usually granted too late</mark>
		- Subsequent <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delays to progress</mark> of work due to contractor's own reasons, variations, and other external factors such as weather and Gov actions
		- Subsequent <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delays in materials delivery</mark>
		- Programme logic or sequence not realistic, or subsequent <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adjustments to sequence of works</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Unplanned change in time of delivery</mark> of equipment or materials, such as lift, sanitary fittings, which attract big sums of payment
	- Cost
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost estimates</mark> either <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not up-to-date</mark> to reflect adjustments to original contract sums, or tend to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">conservatively high</mark> to keep reserves / secure budget
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Provisional sums and contingency sums</mark> not suitably adjusted at appropriate time. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Verbal instructions confirmed very late</mark> particularly when provisional sums and contingency sums are used up or taken out from budget
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Payment</mark> generally tend to be too <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">conservatively low</mark>
	- Forecasting method
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Forecasting method too crude</mark> with little relevance to programme
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Forecasting not done frequent enough</mark> to reflect changes
		- Forecasting method too detailed to take too much time to do each time and therefore cannot be done too frequently
		- Spreading of balance of conservatively high cost estimate over the rest of the contract period <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without due consideration of EOT or delay</mark>
- Measures to improve
	- Time
		- Architects and Engineers to suggest <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">realistic adjustments to contractor's programmes</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Timing of delivery of major equipment</mark> or materials, such as lift, sanitary fittings, which attract big sums of payment to be more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">closely analysed and monitored</mark>
	- Cost
		- For cash flow purposes, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">funding can be transferred from one project to another</mark> so far as the total cash flow is kept reasonable to forecasts to avoid too much buffers allowed in individual project forecasts. Aggregating project together will create a cushioning effect on individual deviations from forecasts.
		- More <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">volatile expenditures such as variations and provisional sums to be shown as a separate item</mark> in the forecasts to give an indication of degree of tolerance of the forecasts, and the buffers in the cost estimates for these expenditure should be reduced as soon as appropriate
	- Forecasting method
		- Cash flow forecasts to be done at more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">regular intervals using pragmatic methods</mark>, not too time consuming yet not too crude

## Reason & Improvement of Contractor's Cash Flow Issue *(2007 Q4.1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reason</mark>
	- There is difference between a contractor's cash-in mode, which is wholly dictated by the provisions of the building contract, and the cash-outlay mode which is based on the contractor's own arrangements with suppliers and tradesmen to facilitate the carrying out of the works in a timely and financially efficient manner.
	- Reasons for differences
		- In most building contract terms and conditions, considerations of the amount payable to contractors resolve around whether such amount represents the value to the Employer. From this imperative, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only "works properly executed and materials and goods delivered to or adjacent to the Works" are payable</mark> under the contract. Contractor's cash outlay, however, does not necessarily match this intention and this creates a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time lag between costs spent and money received</mark>. 
		- Flowing from the above, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">materials</mark> ordered for the contract works will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only be eligible for payment if they are delivered to site and not too prematurely delivered</mark>. Material supply payment terms from the suppliers and their delivery programmes do not, however, necessarily match that of the site progress, particularly where materials are imported, bulk purchased or ordered.
		- Contractor's hedging of rising material costs through early engagement of material supply contracts will result in early cash outlay in the form of deposits, LCs etc being required.  Recovery of these <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">early committed costs</mark> is usually out of sequence with the contract payment schedule.
		- The valuation time, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">certification period and the payment period</mark> in building contracts also contribute to the time lag.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Retention</mark> under the contract contributes to the difference, especially during the early stage of the contract when the maximum retention amount has not been attained yet.
		- For variations to contracts with additional cost effect, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">PQS usually takes a conservative valuation attitude to avoid overpayment</mark>. The situation will also be exacerbated by the insufficient time to properly conduct valuations of variations. 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's pricing strategy during tendering</mark> also contributes to the situation. Where early completed works items have been underpriced, a contractor could only rely on the completion of better priced subsequent work items to recoup the negative cash flow.
		- While the actual costs for securing bond / insurance amounts are usually recoverable by presenting the actual payment receipt to PQS, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hidden cost for securing a bond</mark>, i.e. by the contractor depositing a security to his surety represent another cost to the contractor which is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seldom reflected in the tender sum</mark> especially with the current competitive bidding climate.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Amendment to CC for improvement</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Period of valuation</mark> - fortnightly instead of monthly basis
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bond</mark> requirement, amount, timing of release to be modified so that the demand for cash security to the contractor can be eased
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Retention</mark> requirement and timing of release
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Material off site</mark> to be made payable - with title reverting to the Employer and goods fully insured
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Advance payment</mark> for material ordering or purchase - to be supported with a security in favour of the Employer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer to arrange for supply</mark> of certain materials, including the direct financing option - the Employer however may require tight control of title issue, liability for delivery timing and wastage issues; also special conditions will be required
