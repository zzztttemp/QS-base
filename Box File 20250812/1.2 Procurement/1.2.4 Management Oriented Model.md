## Management Contracting

- Concept
    - Works done by different works contractors under the Management Contractor; works package awarded on a competitive basis
    - Management Contractor to provide site management, preliminary items & buildability advice to the design team
    - Payment basis
        - Pre-agreed lump sum for pre-construction services +
        - Lump sum or % for management and supervision +
        - Cost of site works and contractor's design and other services

- Advantages
    - Time
        - Shorter project duration; overlapping of design and construction to allow early commencement for multi-phase project
        - Phased completion achievable
    - Cost
        - Competitive price from tendered works contracts
    - Quality
        - Improve buildability of design for early participation of the Management Contractor
        - Greater flexibility for Employer to defer decisions and apply new changes on other works contracts
- Disadvantages
    - Cost
        - Less cost certainty; overall cost is unknown until works packages are fully awarded
        - Lower degree of cost control coz design is less advanced at commencement
        - Higher overall cost of construction for overlapping of preliminaries between Management Contractor and works contractors
        - Less incentive for the Management Contractor to be cost effective

### Management Contracting & partnering friendly *(2015 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Management Contracting</mark>
	- The Management Contractor joins the consultant team at the design stage. He tenders a fee to provide services in the pre-construction and construction stages of the project. While he does not carry out the actual construction works, he entered into sub-contracts with Works Contractors who will carry out separate packages of the works. His task is to co-ordinate and supervise the work of various Works Contractors engaged in constructing the works.
	- It provides ways to tap the expertise of the Management Contractor throughout the course of the project including the pre-construction stage. The professional advice on planning, programme and buildability from the contractor's perspective will enrich the ability of the project team to cope with the technical challenges and difficulties which may arise.
	- In a classical management contract, the Management Contractor is not required to take responsibility for the performance of Works Contractors except to the extent that he can offset the responsibility against the Works Contractors. In line with all the other consultants, he is responsible only for the consequences of his own negligence or incompetence. Such an arrangement is intended to preserve the Management Contractor's alliance of aims with the Employer.

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Making the Works Contracts more partnering friendly</mark>
	- Attitude and mindset
		- It may be specified to have a partnering workshop at the beginning of the Works Contract for all key project team members to get to know each other, align their objectives, and understand the need to adopt a partnering mindset.
		- All people must work with mutual trust and respect in a collaborative manner for the best value of the project as a whole. They should move away from adversarial attitude.
		- Partnering workshops should also be conducted during the course of the Works Contract to review achievement and re-align with each other.
		- Commitment at all levels with strong support by the top level is very important
	- Objectives
		- It may be specified to have a partnering charter or agreement drafted and agreed by all parties involved to document the common objectives and an agreement to collaborate to achieve those common objectives
		- Partnering is about serving the interests of both contract parties or all parties involved in the Works Contract. The tender documents can only specify the objectives of the Employer and the Management Contractor. Chances should be given to the Works Contractor to express his objectives so that all parties can collaborate to achieve his objectives also. The consultant teams may also wish their objectives to be achieved.
		- The partnering charter may be drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop.
		- The objectives may be about the final product, such as good quality, on time, within respective budgets, minimum resources, no fatal accidents, few public complaints, better than expected, added value.
		- The objectives may also be about the process, such as planning ahead, identifying problems in advance, exchanging knowledge, warning proactively, adopting best practice, adopting proven practice, reducing wastes, simplifying tasks, cutting red-tape, improving buildability, finding better alternatives, resolving quickly, rectifying immediately, etc.
		- The objectives may also be about the attitude, such as co-operative, honest, frank, trusting, trustworthy, teamwork, empathic, sharing, no blame, no cheating, fair, wins for all, etc.
		- The partnering charter may have quantifiable key performance indicators.
	- Action plan
		- It may be specified to have an action plan drawn up to document the issues, concerns and risks identified in advance, and the parties and time to resolve them, in order to achieve the partnering objectives.
		- The action plan is usually drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop, and monitored and updated regularly
		- The action plan may be integrated with risk and safety management action plans
	- Monitoring
		- It may be specified to have a champion team comprising high level representatives of the Employer, Management Contractor, Works Contractor and Consultants to meet regularly to monitor the progress of the actin plan, rate mutual performance, resolve issues delayed by the lower level of staff, etc.
		- Contractual procedures may be specified to deal with problems through an "early warning" system with notices, meetings, time limits on a "without prejudice" basis. However, better results would be achieved if these are not put forward unilaterally as contractual procedures but are established and agreed by all parties through early joint discussions,
	- Resolution
		- It may be specified to have an issue resolution mechanism or matrix to identify who should be involved in resolving which kinds of problems, the time durations to resolve or, in case of failure to resolve, submit to higher authority for resolution to avoid delay in problem solving.
		- The involvement of an independent third party adviser to facilitate dispute avoidance and resolution throughout the partnering process would also be an advantage particularly in case of contractual deadlock.
	- Risk allocation
		- It is important to allocate risks to the party best placed to control and bear the risks and to ensure provisions relating to payment terms, grounds for EOT and loss and expenses are in line with the principle of fair risks allocation.
		- While the contract terms must be observed when implementing partnering, putting harsh terms and burden all on the Works Contractor is not serving the interest of the Works Contractor and it would be difficult to expect the Works Contractor to work in a partnering spirit.
		- Arrangement such as cost-plus payment will be most welcome by the Works Contractor but this may affect the Employer's cost control. However, if a partnering spirit is strongly kept with genuine effort to control the costs without extravagancies or reserving buffers for negotiation, the costs spent may as well be the most economical.
	- Incentive
		- It may be specified to have an incentive scheme to award the Works Contractor if he can achieve certain partnering key performance indicators, come below a target cost, finish before a certain date, etc.
		- Some projects also adopt a scheme to award the Consultants as well for their contribution to partnering success.
	- Value engineering
		- It may be specified that the Works Contractor is encouraged to suggest proposals to enhance the value of the project by increasing its functions, benefits and worth, and reducing the resources required.
		- The suggestion can be formulated by a value engineering stud by the Works Contractor himself or jointly with other project team members.
		- Successful achievement of the proposals may lead to incentive awards.
	- De-briefing
		- It may be specified to have a debriefing meeting after the completion of the works to review the failures and successes, and to show appreciation. Partnering is about long term relationship. It would be good that all people involved can learn the lessons, get commendations, and look for future collaboration.
 
## Construction Management

- Concept
