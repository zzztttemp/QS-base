## Traditional Model

- Concept
    - Design-bid-build
    - Consultant to design & contract administration
    - Contractor to build
- Advantages
    - Time
        - Time control by consultants
    - Cost
        - More competitive tender prices
        - Certainty of cost before construction
        - Cost control over the project
    - Quality
        - High design quality by consultants
        - Full control over design and quality
    - Other
        - Well understood process
- Disadvantages
    - Time
        - Adequate information before tender out, longer time for tender preparation
        - No overlap between design and construction, longer time for project completion
    - Quality
        - Little design / buildability input from Contractor
    - Risk
        - Design liability on consultant engaged by Employer
        - Risk of claims if instructions from consultants delayed
 
## Lump Sum Contract

- Concept
    - A contract where the Contractor agrees to construct the works for an agreed sum based on a set of contract documents
    - Fixed contract sum subject to variations
    - Irrespective of the actual costs incurred by contractor
- Application
    - Works involving basic trades and skills
    - Adequate information prior to tender
- Advantages
    - Employer
        - High degree of cost certainty, reduce risk of over-budget
        - Indication of final cost at the initial stage, define Employer's financial commitment
        - Provide basis for variation
        - Reduce management input
    - Contractor
        - Incentive to increase cost efficiency
- Disadvantages
    - Employer
        - Require adequate information and substantially finalized design before tender out
    - Contractor
        - Higher risk under fixed price
- BQ
	- A detailed bill is prepared for the basis of pricing with quantities forming part of the contract
	- Advantages to Employer
		- Provide and fair and equal basis for tendering, easier for tender examination
		- MC has to spent less time in estimating and hence shorter tendering period
		- A comprehensive set of unit rates to facilitate the VO valuation, better cost control
		- Employer has a good indication of final cost of work at initial stage
	- Advantages to Contractor
		- Less time for tender preparation and less tender cost
		- Risk of measurement error is reduced
	- Disadvantages to Employer
		- Design requirement has to be substantially finalized before contract award
		- For small projects, quantity can be tedious and expensive
		- Time spent in preparing tender documents is relatively long
		- Risk of measurement error on Employer
- SOR
	- Tenderer prepares SOR and quantities based on tender drawings & spec, but the quantities do not form part of the contract
	- Purpose of dwg & spec
		- Tender document
		- Basis for contractor's pricing
		- Scope of works
		- Cost control document for payment & VO valuations
	- Advantages to Employer
		- Time saved in BQ preparation which shorten the whole tendering process
		- Risk of error in quantities transferred to tenderer
		- An indication of final cost at the initial stage
		- Basis for VO valuation
	- Disadvantages to Employer
		- Since quantities risk is on tenderer, possibly high contingency factors in tender
		- Require a full comprehensive design for tender
		- Tender price may be higher for tenderer's higher cost to prepare SOR
	- Disadvantages to tenderer
		- Have to bear the quantities risk of SOR
		- More time and source for tender preparation

|                                          | BQ         | SOR        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Less time for tender preparation         | Contractor | Employer   |
| Risk of measurement error                | Employer   | Contractor |
| Fair and equal basis for tender analysis | V          | X          |
| Tender period                            | Shorter    | Longer     |
| Fully comprehensive design required      | -          | V          |
| Higher tender price                      | -          | Might      |
 
## Remeasurement Contract

- Concept
	- A contract comprising a priced schedule of rates which forms the basis of ascertaining the amount to be paid for executing the works
    - Works re-measured based on rate
    - Estimated quantities might be provided in tender
- Application
    - Works not fully detailed
    - Maintenance works & civil engineering works
- Advantages
    - No substantially finalized design required
    - Shorter time for tender preparation
    - Encourage early start of construction, overlapping of design and construction
    - Allow flexibility of design change
- Disadvantages
    - Employer
        - Uncertainty of final cost
        - Final measurement required at completion
        - Higher contingency in rates which inflates the tender price
    - Contractor
        - Require adequate allowance for prelim & contingency
- Bills of Approximate Quantities
    - Provide basis for tender submission with estimated quantities
    - Provide a fair indication of cost
- Schedule of Rates
    - Provide basis for addition and omission
    - But difficult for tenderer to quote realistic rates if no indicative quantities provided, need allow higher contingency
 
## Cost Plus (Reimbursement) Contract

- Concept
	- A contract in which the Contractor carries out the works and is paid the prime cost of labour and materials plus either a percentage or a fixed fee to cover his charges and profit
    - Actual prime (direct) cost + management fee (fixed or %)
- Application
    - Works easy to describe scope but not in detail
    - A&A works, disruptive works in existing building
- Contract administration
    - QS to agree with Contractor the method of calculating prime cost
    - Actual prime cost
        - Labour cost
            - Allow on-site worker & supervisory staff
            - Allow working hour & normal overtime
        - Material cost
            - Check if market rate
            - Check if invoiced with delivery notes
            - Allow material waste
        - Plant cost
            - Allow hiring period
    - Cost control
        - Budget estimate & cost update during design evolution
        - Reasonable retention
        - Cost reconciliation between actual & estimated cost
- Advantages
    - No substantially finalized design required
    - Shorter time for tender preparation
    - Early start of construction, overlapping of design and construction
    - Flexibility of design change
    - Employer no need to pay a premium for abnormal risks
- Disadvantages
    - No certainty of final cost, hard to cost control
    - Competition of tender prices will be limited
    - Little incentive for Contractor to minimize cost
    - More administration work for tight cost control & checking of the prime cost
    - Employer carries all risks including inflation and productivity
- Types
    - Cost Plus Percentage Contract
    - Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract
        - If scope of works is well defined
    - Cost Plus Fluctuating Fee Contract
        - Fee paid to Contractor fluctuates inversely if the final prime cost is different from the agreed estimate of cost
        - e.g. final cost < estimated tender price -> higher fee
