## General of D&B

- Concept
    - Contractor to design and build based on Employer's requirements
- Tender
    - Employer's requirements & design brief to tenderers
    - Tenderers to prepare a Contractor's Proposal with tender price
- Advantages
    - Time
        - Fast track; overlapping design and construction; quick start on site
    - Cost
        - Certainty of cost
        - Less risk of claims
	        - From variation
	        - From late instruction
        - Contractor has incentive for economical design, buildability
    - Quality
        - Utilize Contractor's expertise on buildability and efficiency
    - Risk
        - Single point of responsibility
            - Management of consultants diverted to Contractor, no need to appoint design consultants by Employer
            - Improve project organization, communication and cooperation
            - Less project management input from Employer
            - No liability of design error on Employer
    - Administration 
	    - Sub-contract arrangement simplified by not adopting NSC
- Disadvantages
    - Time
        - Longer pre-qualification period
        - Longer time for Contractor to prepare tender
        - Longer time and difficulty to examine tender; calls for a well defined selection criteria of the proposed design
    - Cost
        - Tender price not competitive
        - Higher tendering cost for Contractor
        - Difficulty to quantify the cost of variation - no firm pricing basis
        - Contractor's extra design risk reflect on higher tender price
        - Maximum competition is difficult to obtain as design is not fully developed at tender stage
        - MC has to maintain PII
    - Quality
        - Possible under-design and lower quality
        - Less control over detailed aspects of design
        - Less flexibility in variation, extra cost and time
    - Risk
        - Require premature decision, defined and clear Employer's requirements
    - Other
        - Experience of Employer to adopt D&B
- Disadvantage to MC
	- Lack of management expertise
	- Tendering cost very high
	- Difficult to coordinate with various consultants at both design & construction stages
	- MC has to bear extra design risk which will reflects on the high tender price
- Difficulties of implementation
	- Lack of professional acceptance
		- Architect loses his professional status - reluctant to support and cooperate with MC
	- Lack of promotion
		- Employer still like to adopt traditional approach
	- Unclear about responsibilities
	- Conflict with MC in interpretations of Employer's requirements
	- Lack of VO flexibility
- Reasons to use in public sector
	- Clear objectives to convince approvals of government's funding
		- D&B have tight time constraints and a pre-determined lump sum
		- Time and cost certainty are important in public sector
	- Rigid rules and regulations
		- Little chance of changes under governing rules & regulations
		- Government not likely to issue VO to secure cost certainty
	- Open and fair competition
		- Clear and transparent tendering for fair competition
		- Selection is made on both public interest, public support & political support
		- Comprehensive pre-qualification & marking scheme
	- Acceptance of highest mark tender

### Application of Design & Build *(2001 D1Q2a)*

- Suitable
	- Design situation
		- Employer not having professional design consultants
		- Employer believes that their professional design consultants are too conservative in design
		- Employer has a definite design brief which is unlikely to be changed
		- Employer has open mind and would given flexibility for contractors to design and innovate
	- Buildability & specialty
		- Projects requires contractors who have the specialty design expertise not normally provided by professional design consultants
		- Projects requiring contractors who possess proprietary system or process or special construction plant
	- Liability
		- Employer wants to put all the design risks and liabilities upon the contractors
		- Employers requires contractors to take up a single point responsibility for design and construction
	- Time
		- Project needs fast track by overlapping the design and construction stages.
- Not suitable
	- Design situation
		- Projects require only standard or well proven design leaving very little room for the contractor to improve
		- Project team already provides all the design details leaving very little flexibility for the contractor to design and save cost
		- Employer does not have a definite design brief
		- Project team is unable to draft a suitable design brief / Employer's requirement prior to tendering
		- Volatile user requirements and market situations demanding frequent changes to suit
	- Time
		- Mismatch of statutory submission diminishing the overlapping of the design and construction stages
	- Cost
		- Employer looks for maximizing price competition which may not be feasible due to limited number of contractors having track records of design and build
	- Contractor
		- There are limited number of contractors financially or technically capable of taking up the risks of design and build
		- Contractor unreasonably undercuts the design to cover their underpricing or maximize their profits

### D&B v D&B + Operation and Maintenance *(2022 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Advantages compared with D&B</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Integration of and synergies</mark> 协同效应 between design, construction operation and maintenance can widen the scope of and freedom for innovation and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">optimization</mark> at different stages with lower costs, better buildability and better performance because <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">longer term costs and benefits</mark> can be considered
	- Appointment of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">single contractor provides unity of responsibility</mark>. The Contractor is solely responsible for all stages of the project delivery and the subsequent operation and maintenance of the completed project
	- With a clear specification and requirements, the Employer is mainly responsible for financing the project only, with a hands off role. Employer can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduce or re-deploy his operation and maintenance resources</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Longer term relationship</mark> between the Employer and the Contractor can be established
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Certainty of cost</mark> of constructing, operating and maintaining the project at the award of contract can be increased with lower risk of cost overruns and no <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financial claims due to interfaces</mark> between different stages
	- The long term whole-life focus of this approach is likely to allow for a more robust <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">allocation of risks to and by Contractor</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Knowledge of operating and maintaining the facility</mark> can be transferred from Contractor to Employer at the end of the contract
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Disadvantages compared with D&B</mark>
	- The whole <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender Documents will need to be revised</mark> to include the additional scope and different trade practice for operation and maintenance. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Different disciplines of consultants will need to be engaged</mark>
	- The<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> tendering period will be prolonged</mark> due to the inclusion of operation and maintenance requirements, which can otherwise be done during the construction stage in the case of design and build
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shortlisted four tenderers</mark> may not all be willing and able to tender for the extended scope. More tenderers will need to be invited
	- There will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price premium for the single point responsibility</mark> in the arrangement or have the required capacity
	- There will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price premium because Contractor will have to allow for the risks for a longer term</mark>. The risks of constructing a building, operating and maintaining the building, operating and maintaining the automated carparking systems, carparking revenue, etc are very much different
	- At any stage, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">flexibility</mark> to introduce operational or technical changes to the project in response <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to the market needs will be reduced</mark>
	- At any stage, it will be more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to value the cost implications of changes</mark> to the contract requirements because the contract sum should take into account the operating revenues, and any changes to the contract requirements will also need to take and effect on the revenues into account
	- It will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult for Employer to explore other uses of the building</mark> co-existing with or replacing the carparking business
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the Employer is also operating other carparks</mark>, the image and performance of this project may not align with those other carpark
	- Contractor will have much <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">less incentive to operate and maintain properly</mark> if he has already got the design and construction prices paid leaving much smaller amount for the operation and maintenance services. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Operating revenues</mark> from carparking, advertisement, other co-existing services will need to be taken into account in the contract sum. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The contract sum is unlikely to be a fixed sum</mark> but will be based on a number of cost and revenue variables
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Terminating the services of Contractor and the subsequent accounting will be more difficult</mark> than terminating the services of design and build contractor.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Additional tender assessment requirements and methods on top of D&B</mark>
	- Whether the tenderer processes the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expertise</mark>  in handling operation and maintenance 
	- The tenderer's proposed <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operation and maintenance management plan</mark>
	- Any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">innovative suggestions</mark> by the tenderer which are effective and practicable in improving the delivery of the operation and maintenance services
	- Whether the tenderer will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sub-let all the operation and maintenance services</mark> to a third party as it may have adverse impacts on the quality
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Overall technical assessment</mark> considering the respective scores on design, construction, operation and maintenance, each with a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pre-determined passing score</mark>. Failure to pass certain criteria may lead to disqualification
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reasonableness of the price allocation to the D&B</mark> services against the operation and maintenance services to prevent an unrealistic front loading by Contractor to the D&B stage
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reasonableness of the maintenance cost</mark> proposed by tenderer. High maintenance costs may mean poorer system, but may also mean less front-loading
	- Whether and how the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operation revenues</mark> will be accounted for in the contract sum
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Present value after discounted cash flow</mark> analysis
	- Whether the tenderer possesses any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">statutory certificates in connection with operation and maintenance</mark>, including building management and security

## D&B Good Practice

- Employer's good practice
	- Clear and informative design requirements without ambiguities, specify aesthetic quality & special features
	- Thorough tender examination to ensure no discrepancies from Employer's brief
	- Active participation in design and construction process; effective communication channel
	- Introduce independent design checker / in-house design team / formal QA system to ensure the quality
	- Establish a good communication channel with MC
	- Ensure MC has maintained enough coverage by PII
	- Should not involve in any detail design issues except brief design stage
- Improvements to D&B
	- D&B + Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP)
		- Target cost initially agreed
		- Allow changes to the original specification on reimbursement basis
		- Savings shared by both Employer and Contractor
	- 2-stage tendering
		- Consider the design first then analyze commercial proposal

## Administration of D&B

### ELS Contractor v Engineer Design (2004 Q2C)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor v Engineer design</mark>
	- The shoring, sheet piling and other earthwork support items are temporary work items, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design responsibility</mark> of which usually lies with C pursuant to the CC / SP unless specifically stipulated otherwise in the tender doc
	- However, leaving the whole design to C would run the following <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">risks</mark>
		- C will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only commence</mark> his design works and subsequent approval and consent processing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">after contract awards</mark>, thereby lengthening the overall project duration
		- The tenderer's design assumptions for tendering purposes could sometimes be too <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aggressive</mark> (usually reflected by a low allowance in the tender), resulting in protracted resubmissions during construction, delay to the contract and heavy financial burden to C as a result of his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">underpricing</mark>
	- In order to minimize the above risks, some E will have the ELS <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">designed by their consulting engineering</mark> in advance and have the BD approval processed
	- However, even with an approved ELS design before the award of contract, E still faces the following <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">risks</mark>
		- The consent to be given by BD for actual commencement of ELS works may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">conditional upon certain pre-conditions to be fulfilled by C</mark> (such as satisfactory submission of the C's site safety plan, completion of site hoarding, etc.). This could cause a disputable split of contractual liability in the event in obtaining the consent
		- Engineer's design <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may not necessarily represent a economical design</mark>, and E may opt to tap into <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tenderer's input</mark> and expertise for a better design
		- As the design of ELS is by E's consultant, should there be any need for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">further revision</mark> to the design, all time and cost implication will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">E's liability</mark>
	- Given the above, a possible <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">solution</mark> for E is to have his consulting engineer to design the ELS and process the BD approval on the one hand, but to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">transfer the design risk to C</mark> through tender documentation
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Issues to be addressed in tender doc</mark>
	- Definition that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design responsibility</mark> and obligation to obtain necessary approval and consent rests with the Contractor
	- Stipulation of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">availability of an Engineer's design</mark>, with reference drawings, calculations etc., to be made available for tenderer's reference
	- State clearly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if there is any BD approval</mark> already processed / obtained in respect of the Engineer's design
	- C is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at liberty to adopt the Engineer's design but must assume all responsibilities as if such design is his own</mark>
	- C may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adopt another alternative design of his own</mark> but must bear all time and cost implications for submissions, waiting time for approval and consent, etc.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible change to size and location of basement</mark>
	- As the size and alignment of the basement is still subject to change and would not be finalized before tender return, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer's design </mark>including any approval or consent so far obtained will likely be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to change</mark>
	- Such susceptibility to change will undermine the basis of the above tender documentation method which aims at <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk transfer, and therefore render it not appropriate</mark>
	- C <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cannot be asked to price a lump sum</mark> item for earthwork support for a basement whose size and alignment is not finally decided
	- A possible method in this instance is to ask QS to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prepare a set of provisional qty</mark> based on Engineer's design for pricing by tenderers so as to establish a basis for remeasurement in the post contract stage when the basement design is completed and works constructed

### Alternative D&B foundation proposal *(2016 D1Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Additional information and requirements in Tender Doc</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Two FOT</mark> - one with foundation works based on Engineer's design and one with foundation works based on Contractor's design, for filling in the respective tender sums and contract periods
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Performance specification</mark> for foundation works including <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">scope of the works, requirements for statutory submission and fitness for purpose (life time warranty, independent checking engineers and professional liability insurance)</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Soil investigation report</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Loading schedule</mark>
	- Provisions to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bundle affected work together</mark> so as to prevent the Contractor from exploiting savings in foundation design at the expense of other work, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">e.g. pile caps</mark>
	- Provisions requiring tenderers to submit their design proposals together with following relevant information:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Experience</mark> and expertise in foundation design
		- Preliminary foundation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design proposal</mark> (including implications on the pile cap design)
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Method statement</mark> for the foundation works
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Price breakdown</mark> for the foundation works
		- Overall design and construction <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">More tendering time</mark> should be allowed for tenderer to prepare design proposal
	- Consider <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fall back solution if Contractor's design cannot obtain statutory approval</mark>
		- Contractor to revise design at own cost and absorb lost time
		- Use Engineer's design if allowed by contract
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Factors</mark> to be considered for assessment
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost</mark> saving as compared to the Engineer's design, including the cost implications of pile caps
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Time</mark> to complete as compared to the Engineer's design with due allowance for design and statutory submission
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Technical merits</mark> including suitability for use on this particular site and possibility of getting statutory approval
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Environmental</mark> impacts such as smock and noise
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Safety</mark> requirements such as vibration and settlement
	- Tenderer's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">experience</mark> and expertise in design foundation works
	- Tenderer's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financial capacity</mark> to take risks

### Evaluation process *(2011 D1Q2b)*

- Selection of a contractor is usually based on the price and technical submission of the tenderers. For D&B tenders, the technical submissions would be extended to include the tenderers' preliminary design proposals which would be the prime issue before all other things. 
- For <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">private</mark> sector projects, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">price submission and technical submission would usually be opened up together</mark>, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender sums would initially set the priority for short-listing</mark> the tenderers for evaluation. The tenderers' preliminary design proposals would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">checked to see whether they meet the minimum requirements</mark> of the design brief (Employer's requirements) included in the tender documents. If a preliminary design proposal fails to meet the conforming requirements, it will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disqualified</mark> and the next tender in the queue will be added to the short-list. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender clarifications</mark> by means of questions and answers may be exchanged with shortlisted tenderers. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender interviews</mark> are usually conducted. Private sector projects are more relaxed to entertain or even request for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adjustments to the tender sums</mark> before <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract award</mark>. Opportunity may be taken to iron out deviations from the design brief.
- Apart from the practice as described above, it is not uncommon for some private developers to follow the tender opening procedures as adopted in the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Gov</mark> project where the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">price submissions and technical submissions would usually be opened up and evaluated separately</mark>. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">screening</mark> exercise may be conducted to ensure that a tenderer's preliminary design proposal <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">meets the conforming requirements</mark> of the design brief before it is processed further. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">technical submission will then be evaluated</mark> in details and given <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">technical scores against pre-set criteria</mark> made known to tenderers. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender clarifications</mark> would also be conducted but purely for the purpose of clarifications. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender interviews are not usual</mark> but may be conducted. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Adjustments to the tender sums before contract award would not be permitted</mark>. The price submission would be checked and scored separately. The price score and technical score would be combined together based on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pre-set weighting</mark> also made known to tenders. The tender securing the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">highest score</mark> would be the winning bid.
- Costs such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">life cycle costs, cost implications of different designs, completion times</mark>, etc. May also be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">added to the tender sums for a total comparison</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Conforming requirements</mark> may include fundamentals like achieving the minimum amount of GFA / CFA, building height not exceeding the maximum height restrictions, providing sufficient loading, etc.

### Selection criteria and information required *(2011 D1Q2c)*

- Suitable <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design</mark>
	- Demonstrated by preliminary design drawings with architectural plans, elevations and sections, perspectives and renderings, structural plans, E&M schematics, site and landscape layouts, descriptions of design parameters and standards, area schedules, schedule of accommodations, descriptions of functions, provisions and material standards, performance data, etc.

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sustainable</mark>
	- Demonstrated by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lift cycle cost plans and maintenance</mark> and repair requirements and cycles
- Good <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">marketability</mark>
	- Demonstrated by business plans if marketability (sale, lease or use) is also a requirement of the design brief
- Other
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Site safety plan, environmental plan, quality plan, waste management plan, energy efficiency, green features</mark>

### VO for loading change *(2018 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Contractual analysis</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Binding contract </mark>
		- The tender documents were prepared based Architect's design with BQ, but the foundation works were required to be included in the tender based on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's design</mark>. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantities</mark> estimated by the Contractor based on his design and indicated in the lump sum price breakdown for the foundation works shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not form part of the Contract</mark>.
		- The piling design prepared by SE thought issued to the Contractor for tendering was marked to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for reference only and therefore does not form part of the Contract</mark>.
		- The mere fact that the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantities in the price breakdown match nicely with the reference</mark> design prepared by SE does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not necessarily follow that the quantities or the reference design shall form part of the Contract</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VO basis</mark>
		- For the same contract sum, the Contractor shall be and shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only be responsible for</mark> providing a piling design <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sufficient to support the building in compliance with the original contract requirements</mark>. Any up or down <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">errors</mark> made in the preliminary design or in the estimated quantities or rates shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not result in any adjustment to the contract sum or completion time</mark>
		- Instead of comparing against the quantities stated in the price breakdown, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the variation shall be valued by comparing the piling design </mark>that has or would have been prepared by the Contractor fulfilling the original contract requirements, i.e. the baseline piling design based on the original loading schedule, against the revised piling design based on the revised loading schedule under site instruction
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">consequential changes</mark> to the rest of the foundations designed by the Contractor should also be considered
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Suggested approach</mark>
	- In order to compare between the original and the revised piling designs, it is necessary to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">identify the baseline design which is the one fulfilling the original contract requirements</mark>
		- As part of the supporting information for his submitted quotation, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor should be requested to provide the baseline design</mark> as the basis of the omission cost in variation
		- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preliminary design</mark> may have been submitted by Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at the tender stage</mark> but this <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">usually</mark> would be regarded as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for reference only</mark>. However, it is advisable to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">check</mark> the Contract or, if the formal Contract Documents have not been prepared yet, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">correspondence</mark> exchanges during the tender stage to see <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the Contractor has submitted any piling design which has been agreed upon to form part of contract </mark>as the baseline design. In the absence of an accepted baseline design before the award of the contract, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">baseline design must be the one submitted by the contract after the award of contract and accepted by the SE</mark> as fulfilling the original contract requirements 
		- If non baseline design has been submitted or if the previous design submitted by the contractor did not fulfill the original contract requirements, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contractor should be required to submit or re-submit the baseline design for acceptance by SE</mark> as fulfilling the original contract requirements
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SE's acceptance of baseline design</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Even though the acceptable design may result in fewer</mark> or lighter piles than those stated in the lump sum price breakdown, SE cannot insist on adding more piles. The baseline design so accepted shall be used for the valuation of the variation as described earlier
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Impact on other elements</mark>
		- SE should also be reminded to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">check the implication on the pile caps and tie beams</mark> design so as to ensure that there is no undue saving in piling costs at the expense of pile caps and tie beams costs. The cost effects on the pile caps and tie beams should also be considered as part of the variation. The principle as described for the piles in respect of comparing between the designs before and after the loading schedule revision should also apply to the pile caps and tie beams.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If Contractor refused to submit any baseline design</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Advice from SE</mark> should be sought regarding a notional baseline piling design for the purpose of valuation of variation

### Change fm SE design to Contractor design to save time *(2019 D1Q3a)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual feasibility</mark>
	- It is contractually feasible to procure the foundation works as a design and build item as far as the scope of the works and design liability are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clearly stated</mark> in the Contract
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible benefits</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility for design and obtaining Government approval</mark> and consent will usually passed on to the Contractor
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks of gound conditions</mark> may also be passed on to the Contractor
	- While more risks are passed on to the Contractor, the valid chances for the Contracgtor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">claim EOT will be reduced</mark>
	- The tenderer may be able to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">propose a better solution</mark> to suit his plant resources, and design and build expertise, with time and cost benefits
	- Contractor may have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">greater incentive to optimize the design</mark> to suit his resources, with time and cost benefits
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible problems and issues</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Any ambiguity in Contract or any change of the scope of work</mark> and design liability for D&B item will still become a variation which will have EOT entitlement as well
	- The foundation loading schedule will usually be given to Contractor during tendering to form his basis for tendering. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">change of the loading schedule</mark> will be variation
	- Contractor can only start his design after the award of Contract, while <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer's design can start earlier</mark> and gain time for Government approval and consent.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Including Engineer's foudation works design</mark> in the Tender Documents for tenderers' reference only and taking up the risks is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">one usual solution</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Moving forward the tendering time to secure Contractor's foundation works design may mean earlier freeze of the superstructure design</mark> and lesser time for the development of the deatils for the rest of project
	- Whether there will be time advantage as compared to Engineer's design would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">depend on the time left from now until the respective times for obtaining Government consent</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time spent by Architect is approving Contractor's design</mark> may become too long and result in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark> entitement
	- Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme may have no or little buffer for disapproval by Government</mark>
	- Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have expertise in foundation</mark> works and will have to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sublet</mark> to others. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expected design and cost benefits may be reduced</mark>.
	- More intensive post contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">supervision</mark> and monitoring may be required as there may be higher tendency for Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design down to cut cost</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time goal</mark>
	- The suggestion can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduce the Contractor's EOT entitlement</mark> but is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unlikely to reduce Contractor's actual possibility of delays</mark>
