## Target Cost
### Target Cost Contract

- Concept
	- Based on reimbursement of actual costs plus a free or %
	- Target cost - a pre-estimate of prime cost based on tenderer's estimate
    - Actual prime cost + management fee (fixed or %) + further payment according to comparison of actual cost against target price
- Tender
	- Pre-qualification is important 
	- Define cost and fee
		- Define scope of cost to be reimbursed 
		- Complementary: any cost not include in one will be deemed to be included in the other
	- Cost 
		- Tenderer to submit an estimate of costs based on drawings and specification. 
		- Rates for adjustment to target cost
		- Possible no cost estimate during tender stage
	- Management fee
		- Percentage
			- Mark-up on the actual costs
			- May be calculated on a sliding scale
		- Fee
			- Lump sum preliminaries
			- Lump sum attendance
			- Percentage overheads and profit
	- Target cost may be cost + fee + contingencies
	- Possible lump sum price arrangement
		- Target cost = lump sum price + fee + contingencies
		- Adjustment of lump sum price same as normal lump sum contract
- Adjustment of target cost
	- Permissible adjustment
		- Define in contract
			- Usually change of scope of works only
			- Exclude change to complete the works
		- Less than normal variation and loss & expense
	- Non-permissible adjustment
		- Allow in the target cost
		- Contractor's cost saving proposal - if approved, variation but not adjust target cost to encourage
- Payment
	- Open book cost accounting system
- Subletting (may include mechanism)
	- Admissible expenditure of actual cost subject to competitive tendering conducted by Contractor 
	- Selected sub-con subject to Employer's approval
	- May specify cost threshold invoking tendering
	- However, may delay the programme
- Partnering measures
	- State in contract
		- E.g. partnering workshop, setting up a partnering charter, encouragement of joint discussions and resolution of problems
	- Encourage joint resolution of problems
	- High level of cooperation between Employer and Contractor
- Pain / gain share
	- Pre-determined formula
	- May be of a sliding scale
	- May set a cost cap, overrun borne by Contractor
- Advantages 
    - More incentives for Contractor to reduce cost
    - Contractor's buildability / cost saving input
    - Both parties can contribute to management of risks
    - More cost certainty than cost plus, but less than lump sum fixed
    - Early involvement before design completed
- Disadvantages 
    - Incorrect target setting can drive focus on raising the target through claims 
    - Not easy to derive a correct incentive mechanism (the pain / gain formula) so as to drive the right behavior of the Contractor
    - Limited number of standard forms of contract using target cost; most contractor not familiar with this type of contract
    - Well suited to long term relationships but not for one-off project; trustworthy contractor is important
    - More administration cost by Employer, Consultants and Contractor
	    - Contractor: training & partnering workshop, open book account, transparent subletting process & approvals
	    - Consultant: check open book account
	    - Employer: consultancy fee

### Target cost for warehouse *(2018 D1Q4)*


- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Additional requirement</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Type of contract</mark> - target cost contract based on reimbursement of actual costs plus a fee
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Target cost</mark> - a pre-determined target cost or mechanism for fixing the target cost based on the tenderer's estimate of the costs will be stated
	- The target cost <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">plus Contractor's fee and the Employer's contingencies</mark> for permissible adjustments to the target cost should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">less than maximum budget</mark>. The target cost itself should contain an allowance for changes not permissible to adjust the target cost
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Adjustment of target cost</mark> - circumstances that the target cost will be adjusted will be specified. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">normal definition of variations and events leading to loss and expense</mark> compensation under a lump sum contract will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduced</mark>. Variations will usually be defined to mean a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">change of the scope of the works only, excluding any necessary changes to complete the works</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Fees</mark> - the tenderers will be asked to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quote their percentage fees or lump sum fees or  a combination </mark>of both, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without or without benefit of a cost estimate</mark>. The percentage fee will be expressed as a mark-up on the actual costs, and may be calculated on a sliding scale. The fee can be specified to include lump sum preliminaries, lump sum attendance, percentage overheads and profit. A definition of what should be included in the preliminaries, attendance and overheads will be stated.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pain / gain share</mark> - apartment from the fee, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pre-determined formula</mark> to calculate the pain / gain share of the difference between the final actual costs and the target cost will be stated. The pain / gain share may be of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sliding scale.</mark> A c<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ost cap </mark>may also be set so that any cost overrun beyond the target cost by a certain percentage is not reimbursable to the Contractor
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's cost saving proposal</mark> - any cost saving proposal by the Contractor will not be regarded as variations and will have no effect on the target price so as to encourage the Contractor to suggest cost saving proposals. The cost saving proposals must be agreeable by Employer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Payment</mark> - the Contractor will be reimbursed the actual costs supported by an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">open book cost accounting system</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Definition of cost and fee </mark>- what can be and cannot be included in the actual <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost to be reimbursed will be clearly stated.</mark> The definitions of cost and fee will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complementary with one</mark> of them to contain a catch-all statement that any cost not failing into one will be deemed to be included in the other
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost estimate</mark> - the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tenderers may be required to submit an estimate of the costs</mark> based on the drawings and specification. The estimated total cost plus fee and contingencies may become the target cost. The breakdown will serve post contract monitoring of the actual costs. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rates will be used to value cost adjustment</mark> to the target cost. It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">possible that no cost estimate</mark> is expressly mentioned. In any case, the Contractor will be obliged to submit cost estimate and regular financial reports during the post contract stage
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Subletting</mark> - a mechanism will be specified such that the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expenditure admissible to the actual costs</mark> will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to competitive tendering</mark> conducted by the Contractor where the selected suppliers and sub-contractors and the awarded prices must be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approved</mark> by the Employer. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost threshold invoking tendering</mark> may be specified. However, this may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay the programme</mark>
	- Partnering encouragement - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">partnering measures</mark> may be specified to encourage joint resolution of problems with a view to achieve the desired quality below the target cost and complete on time. Target cost contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">requires a higher level of co-operation</mark> between the Employer and Contractor so as to drive the Contractor to innovate, save costs, work efficiently and solve problems as the project proceeds. Accordingly, measures to promote partnering should be stated in the contract, for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">example</mark>, partnering workshop, setting up a partnering charter, encouragement of joint discussions and resolution of problems, etc.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Lump sum price arrangement</mark> - it is also possible that the tenderers are required to give a lump sum based on the drawings and specification plus some contingencies to become a target price. Adjustment of the lump sum price will resemble the normal lump sum contract. The only differences will be that Contractor's cost saving proposal will be permitted and pain / gain share mechanism will be in place
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Recommendation or not</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost savings by adopting target cost contracts are mainly achieved by</mark>
		- Permitting Contractor to propose cost saving proposals
		- Relieving his risks and therefore his risk allowances over suppliers' and sub-contractors' prices which are not fixed at the time of the Contractor's tendering
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Early completion by adopting target cost contracts is mainly achieved by</mark> getting the Contractor on board before completion of the design
	- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">this project</mark>, it should be considered whether the above conditions exist
	- Despite the design for the development is completed for the Contractor to establish a realistic target cost, together with the inclusion of a cost cap so that any budget overrun will be wholly borne by the Contractor, the adoption of target cost contract is not recommended for the current development due to the following reasons:
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Unlikely to have any significant cost savings</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design already completed</mark> - given the completeness of the design, there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">little room</mark> for early contractor involvement to realize the potential cost cost savings by providing advice on buildability. Cost saving proposals may likely downgrade the existing design
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Simple project nature</mark> - given the simplicity in nature of the development, it is unlikely that the Contractor can suggest significant cost saving proposals
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tight construction time frame</mark> - the already tight construction time frame renders <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">early completion of the development difficult</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Any savings related to site supervision cost are unlikely</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Possibility of cost overrun</mark> - in view of the completeness of the design and its simplicity in nature, the possibility of cost overrun is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">little</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Additional cost incurred by Employer, Consultants and Contractor</mark>
			- Employer's own cost - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra cost will be required for arranging trainings and partnering workshops</mark> to enhance the level of understanding and cooperation between Employer, consultants and Contractor
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Additional consultancy fee</mark> - the consultants may request for additional fees, especially in providing more resources in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">checking the Contractor's open-book accounts</mark> against may invoices and receipts
			- Higher Contractor's administration cost - as the Contractor will have to account for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sub-letting process in a transparent</mark> manner to the Employer, will need to obtain more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approvals</mark>, and will need to operate an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">open book accounting system</mark>, the administrative time spent will be more than that on the normal lump sum contracts where the Contractor can have autonomy to decide
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Milestone payments</mark> - while it is still possible to use milestone payments, it will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be as straightforward</mark> as to be used on lump sum contract because there may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be confident lump sums readily available</mark> for the milestone payments
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Delays to completion of the development</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender document modification</mark> - additional time will be required to modify the existing tender documents which will further delay the overall completion of the development
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pre-qualification of contractor</mark> - an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inexperienced</mark> or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">claim conscious</mark> contractor may jeopardize the target cost contracting process and not all contractors have experience in operating a target cost contract. A pre-qualification exercise may be required to shortlist contractors for tendering. This <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may defer the whole tendering process</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Inherent risks of adopting target cost contract</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost certainty</mark> - the main concern of the Employer is cost certainty. Target cost arrangement does not excel in offering cost certainty to the Employer
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Target setting</mark> - incorrect target setting can drive a focus on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">raising the target through claims</mark> rather than suggesting innovative savings
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Risk sharing mechanism</mark> - it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not easy</mark> to derive a correct incentive mechanism (the pain / gain formula) so as to drive the right behavior of the Contractor
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Limited contract forms</mark> - there is limited number of standard forms of contract using target cost. Ad-hoc drafting of contract clauses may lead to misunderstanding of liabilities between the parties
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Well suited to long term relationships</mark> - use of target cost favours the establishment of long term relationship but not for one-off project

## Guarantee Maximum Price
### General of GMP

- Concept
	- It is agreed that the contract sum will not exceed a specified maximum
	- MC is responsible for cost overruns greater than GMP unless GMP has been increased by a formal change order
	- Saving is usually set to be shared by Employer & MC or solely shared by MC
- Combination with procurement
	- Combine with target cost
	- Combine with D&B
- Advantages
	- Transfer all construction responsibility & risk of design development (DD) to MC
	- Early appointment of MC in design process
	- MC contributes to buildability & environmental issues
	- Time & cost saving by competitive open-book price of MC & sub-con
	- Employer retains control over the consultants during pre & post contract design stages
	- Employer's cost certainty
	- Incentive for MC to save cost
	- Implement partnering relationship; greater trust among parties to establish team spirit; less dispute
	- FA can be finalized earlier as VO will be agreed progressively during construction
 - Disadvantages
	 - Employer
		 - Incomplete design when engaging MC, might have future VO & abortive works during construction
		 - Dispute on whether AI constitutes scope change variation or DD variation
		 - MC may price high for DD allowance
		 - MC may sacrifice the quality to save cost
		 - Potential high consultant fee & administration input
		 - Changes are inevitable and no guarantee of maximum price
		 - Subcon of MC might not fully understand GMP, and assume variations arising out of design development can be reimbursed causing dispute
	- Contractor
		- Higher risk if insufficient allowance for design development (DD) in tender
		- Sub-con may not fully understand the concept of GMP thinking all variations could be reimbursed
		- No additional profit & overhead if AI constitutes design development only

### GMP cost components

- Non-adjustable cost portion
	- Fixed price lump sum items
	- Including MC's direct works, attendance, prelim, profit & OH, design & coordination fees
	- Alternatives adopted by MC is considered as design development (DD), GMP not to be adjustment, and additional cost borne by MC
- Adjustable cost portion
	- Not well-defined during tendering
	- Usually are NDSC / NSC items & MC's allowance
	- Scope change variations (GMPV) initiated by Employer
	- Any savings from MC's proposal

### Variation

- Must be covered by AI
- Both DD & GMPV do not cover change of construction sequence, method statement, and additional works outside original scope of works
- Design Development (DD)
	- Not scope change, not initiate an adjustment to GMP
	- DD example
		- Non-measured items as described in dwg & spec but not mentioned in BQ
		- Defined in contract as DD
	- Payment 
		- Paid in IP by expending DD allowance in BQ
		- After total amount of DD in BQ is utilized, MC to bear the cost
		- If DD allowance not fully expended, shared based on contract agreement (MC / MC & E)
- Scope change (GMPV)
	- VO involve adjustment to the GMP
	- GMPV limited to following:-
		- Materially change the overall floor plan are / building volume
		- Materially change the function of area
		- Materially change the quality level of area
		- Adjust pro qty / expenditure of pro sum
		- Correct material errors by consultants
		- Change of statutory requirements
		- Abortive work not due to default of MC

### Application of GMP

- Tender
	- Before agreeing GMP, agree the sum for design development allowance, pro sum & reasonable O&H
	- After agreeing GMP, MC submit a new tender based on the original tender document with the agreed GMP
	- MC provide all information on open-book basis
		- Prelim, DSC competitive pricing basis, attendance on SC, details of MC's direct works, detailed breakdown of MC's profit & overhead
		- Any alternative proposal with cost savings, changes to programme & quality of works
	- QS ensure the price is market rates
- LOA
	- GMP sum, respective breakdown & mode of adjustment
	- Entitlement of saving
	- Scope of works, LD, contract period, etc.
	- SC procurement arrangement
