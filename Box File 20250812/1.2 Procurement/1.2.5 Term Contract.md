## General of Term Contract

- Concept
    - Works with specific nature and limit of cost for an agreed period (years) based on a priced schedule of rates (with annual inflation)
    - A contract where the actual items and quantities of work is not fully determined upon the award of the Contract but will be instructed by means of works order to the Contractor who would stand by for a fixed period of time (2 to 3 years) to carry out the work as instructed during this period
- Application
    - Maintenance works
	    - The items of work are recurring over time
		- The size of each batch of work is small
		- The exact scope, quantities, time of each batch of work cannot be identified or quantified at the time of tender
		- Each batch of work requires commencement at short notice
		- The work requires intensive user interface
		- Work normally is repair in nature requiring little element of new design
    - Public sector
    - Approved list of contractors is common
- Advantages
    - Lower price
    - Short time for tender preparation and tendering
    - Contractor with long term relationship, familiar with the building
- Disadvantages
    - Annual fee adjustment needed
    - Order has to be tied-in with the end and beginning of a contract period
    - Administration for measurement and checking
    - Require familiar and reputable contractor
- Compare with other procurement method
	- In-house labour would involve long term staffing costs which may not be flexible enough to adjust in line with fluctuations in workload
	- Lump sum contract for the same period would not be possible because of the indefinite nature of the maintenance work
	- Calling quotations for each batch of work would be time consuming and administratively ineffective
 
## Practice of Term Contract

- Pricing 
	- In the form of percentage adjustments to SOR rates

	- Pitfalls
		- SOR are out-of-date
			- SOR updated no more than 3-5 years
			- Rates are out-of-date
			- New work or materials might not be updated
			- Price levels of items within the same work section may not change uniformly with time
		- Qty are not certain at the time of tendering
			- If future required qty not given, percentage might be manipulated to make a balance rather than reflecting market price
			- Assigned qty and wrights to different trades may not match the future requirement
		- Contractor might avoid carrying out under-priced items 
	- Tender analysis

		- Approximate values / Percentage weightings / Approximate quantities / Estimated total budget 
			- Estimated with reference to past records with projection for the coming term
			- Pros
				- Providing a good common basis for tendering with less speculation by tenderers
				- Providing a better indication of the scope, proportions, nature, items and quantities of work to enable tenderers to price the tenders with better accuracy
				- Adjustment percentages would be more compatible with the quantities of work to be carried out
				- Providing a more realistic budget for future cost control purpose
				- Providing a basis for explaining variance in future need against the estimated quantities
				- Providing a basis for checking unreasonable loading of adjustment percentages which may prejudice against the Employer
			- Cons
				- Less flexible for the Employer to change when there is a restriction on the quantities
- Attention in Tender Doc
	- No possession of site in the existing building in use
	- Possible existing hidden defects
	- Insurance to existing building
	- Phased completion might be required
- Works order
- Payment
