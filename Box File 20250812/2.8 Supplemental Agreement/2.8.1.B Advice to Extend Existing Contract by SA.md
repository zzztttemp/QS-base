## Letter

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">With reference to our earlier discussion on</mark> the possible arrangements of the office refurbishment in the Lockhart Exchange, which is subject to a tight time constraint for completion by early next year.
 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Amongst the other feasible contractual arrangements</mark>, including the open tendering process, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">we consider the suggestion to</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">extend the existing contract</mark> for the renovation to lift lobbies and toile areas in the Exchange the most feasible solution <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on the following reasons</mark>:
 
1. By arranging the work to be carried out by the same main (and sub-) contractor, the problem of two main contractors working on the same site can be alleviated; <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if not, the following problems</mark> may arise:
	
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Access problem and congested use of the lifts for vertical transportation</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Physical site demarcation for two separate contractors</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Split of liability in the event of insurance claims</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Interfacing between existing and new contract works</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Risk of dispute</mark>
	
2. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Site preliminaries can be minimized</mark> as shared use of existing facilities for the two contracts can be achieved 4. The contractor can <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">start immediately</mark> on site due to shortened pre-contract period
	
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Regarding the contractual arrangement, we suggest that</mark> it should be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">kept separate from the existing contract (Main and sub-contracts) for administrative reasons</mark> (two architects for the two jobs). <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However</mark>, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">an agreement should be sought with the existing main and sub-contractors to hook the price level with those in the existing contract</mark>. It may be possible that the main and sub-contractors will ask for percentage loading to their original rates for that purpose.
 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The contract itself can be</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a remeasurement contract</mark> with the remeasurement rates pre-agreed by referencing to the existing contract. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Alternatively</mark>, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">if the design has been finalized to a certain detail, a specification and drawing contract basis</mark> can be used, with the above pre-agreed rates as a basis for variations.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In view of the urgency of the above, your decision on the final contract form is essential.</mark>
