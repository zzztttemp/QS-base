#### Rate and extension mismatch *(2023 D1Q2b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Error in rate but reasonable extension</mark>
	- Similar to Item A - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">check whether</mark> the Employer's Representative's observation is correct.
	- In this case, by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">comparison with the current market rates</mark>, mostly in the range between HK $1,000/No - HK $2,000/No for electrical power points in fitting out works of this nature, the tender rate at <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">HK$15,000/No</mark> is considered <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">substantially over-priced</mark>.
	- By dividing the extension amount by the quantity, the unit rate is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">HK$1,500/No</mark> which appears to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in line with the market rates</mark>.
	- Bonus: The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">typical conditions of tendering</mark> will specify that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">either the rate or the extension amount but not both can be corrected in case of mismatch</mark>. For example, if the rate derived by dividing the extension amount by the quantity is more reasonable by reference to similar items in the SOR, the extension can be adjusted to match. Unfortunately, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the conditions of tendering for this tender are silent</mark>.
	- Bonus: if it were tendered based on <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">BQ</mark>, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantity cannot be changed</mark>.
	- In case of mismatch error like 100 No @ $15,000/No = $150,000, where the arithmetically corrected extension amount is $1,500,000, the first thing is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">check whether the tender sum is based on</mark> $150,000 or $1,500,000. If it is based on $1,500,000, then $150,000 is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">typographical error</mark> to be corrected.
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender sum is based on</mark> $150,000, then the next step is to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">correct the unit rate to match the quantity</mark>. The unit rate will be $150,000 / 100 No = $1,500/No. If it is considered that $1,500/No is of reasonable order by comparing with other rates, then this rate should be adopted, notwithstanding whether the quantity is reasonable or not.
	- If the matching rate is not reasonable, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">quantity</mark> may need to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">checked to see whether it is reasonable</mark>. Since this is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SOR</mark> with quantities estimated by tenderer, the quantities may have been wrong. It is reasonable to request adjustment of the SOR such that the quantities are reasonable, and the rates are adjusted to match the reasonable quantities and the tender sum. The tender sum will still be binding.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If neither $150,000 nor $1,500,000</mark> matches the tender sum, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">item can be corrected to reasonable quantity and reasonable rate</mark>. The resultant discrepancy with the tender sum should be treated as an aggregated <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">arithmetical error</mark>.
	- Correction of contentious errors should be communicated to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tenderer to obtain agreement</mark>
	- Bonus: Depending on different consultant's or client's practice, correction of obvious arithmetical errors may not be communicated to the tenderers to obtain their agreements but would only be communicated with the successful tenderer during the post contract stage.

#### Missing page (2023 D1Q2c)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Missing page</mark>
	- Check if the page is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">missing</mark> from the submitted tender
	- Check if the items on that page are listed <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">on other pages or merged</mark> with other items in SOR
	- Issue tender clarification <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">requesting</mark> the tenderer to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">submit the missing page with the page total tally with the amount on the collection page</mark>. Since this request may provide an opportunity for the tenderer to improve his tender and result in an advantageous position over the other tenderer, upon submission of the missing page, the consultant QS should check the items, quantities and rates, and also compare with other tenders to ensure that the tenderer would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not manipulate</mark> the unit rates <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to his advantage</mark>. Request for corrections are necessary 
	- In principle, the missing page should <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">not affect the rule that the tender sum</mark> includes for the whole of the Works tendered for, the missing page contains useful information for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valuation of interim payments and variations</mark>. As long as the risk of tenderer's intentional manipulation is eliminated, the request for submission for analysis and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inclusion in the Contract is necessary</mark>.
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ASD</mark> would deem the items on missing page as priced at <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">zero rates and treat the amount on collection page as an arithmetical error</mark>. This would cause inconvenience to the valuation of interim payments and variations. Furthermore, the arithmetical error may be big enough to be applied as a percentage adjustment to other rates.

### Examination of BQ / SOR

- Obvious pricing error
	- E.g. rate lower than P.C. supply rate
- Exceptionally high / low rate
	- Judge
		- Compare amongst tender rates & PTE rates
		- Deviation over 100%
		- Shall be at least adequate to cover pc supply rate / material cost
	- High rate: assessed rate for Variation
		- If agree, apply to excessed qty
		- If not agree, fair valuation
	- Low rate: confirm to comply with requirements
- Inconsistent rate
	- Agree rate for variations
- Un-priced / "included" items
	- Agree rates with tenderer for future variations
- ‘excluded’ items
	- Ask tenderer to withdraw qualification
- Lump sum pricing
	- Ask tenderer to submit breakdown if necessary
- Pricing of Preliminaries
	- Any inappropriate pricing of prelim items which should not normally be priced
- Daywork %
- Front loading
	- Discounted cash flow analysis based on tenderers' programme
	- Report to Employer
- Amendment to BQ / SOR
	- Description
	- Quantities
	- Pre-priced rates / amounts

#### Possible reasons for high rates and to do *(2023 D1Q2a)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Ground floor lift lobby ceiling lamps</mark>
	- Firstly, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">verify the rates inserted</mark> in the submitted SOR and quoted by supplier are as what the Employer's Representative said. Clarify with the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">supplier</mark> what are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">included in or excluded from his rate</mark>, e.g. delivery cost, power source, fixing accessories, sample, long delivery period, etc.
	- Check also if the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">quantity</mark> of lamps inserted is correct, or there may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pricing strategy, i.e. in anticipation of variation addition</mark>, though the chance appears to be small in the present case.
	- The tenderer may base on rates from <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">another supplier</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tender rate</mark> should on top of the supply cost include <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">installation cost, and contractor's profit and overheads</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Complex hanging system, high ceiling height, and the need to assemble the lamps on site, associated alteration to existing ceiling, electrical work if no priced elsewhere, etc.</mark>, can all increase the installation costs.
	- It would be reasonable to request the tenderer to submit rate <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">breakdown or justification</mark> for review.
	- Bonus: There may be chances that this high rate can be used as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pro-rata basis for other variation additions</mark>.
	- The tenderer may simply have made a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mistake</mark>.
	- It is very likely that the Employer's Representative would like to ask for price reduction. However, as it is a lump sum tender, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tender sum should remain unchanged</mark> even if some of the price build-up is wrong. 
	- For <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">high-priced items</mark>, it is a common practice for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">private</mark> projects to ask the tenderer to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">submit reasonable (reduced) rates or accept the assessed rate</mark> by the consultant QS for valuation of variation, in particular for those items likely to have variation additions, not variation omissions. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender sum should remain unchanged</mark>. If the chance of variation is small, there may not be a real need to adjust the rates.
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If Employer ask for price reduction</mark>, this should be handled with care to avoid suspicion of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">collusion</mark> with that tenderer or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unfairness</mark> to other tenderers. The shortlisted tenderers may be requested to submit their <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final sealed offers</mark> (after all the tender queries have been clarified) to be returned at the same time for final selection.
	- Bonus: It is also a common practice for private projects to agree more <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reasonable rate for low-priced items</mark> because low rates may be disadvantageous to the Employer in case of variation omissions. Professionally, the consultant QS should identify all incorrect high or low priced items for agreeing reasonable rates for valuation of variations whether they are omissions or additions so that the valuation themselves are fair and reasonable to both parties for changes in either direction, instead of selectively speculating to the Contractor's disadvantages all the time.
	- Bonus: Draw the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">design team's</mark> attention to the above for comments
	- Bonus: Assessed rates are normally not required for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">government</mark> contracts for high-priced or low-priced items. Instead, these items are detailed in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender report for drawings the design team's attention</mark> to control the cost implication in the event of future variations.

### Cost Analysis

- Rate Bill
- Comparative Trade by Trade / Bill by Bill Breakdown
- Comparative Unit Rates of Major Items
- Equating tenders with different completion times 
	- Normally using the rate of LAD

## Evaluation Criteria

- Criteria shall be established before invitation
- Two envelope
	- See 1.5.2 Conditions of Tender
- Common criteria for technical score (see 1.2.3 D&B)
	- Company's financial capability
	- Track record (experience)
	- Record of safety, convictions, quality control, environmental aspect, etc.
	- Resources (technical staffing, plant & equipment)
	- Design and project team
	- Current workload
	- Technical proposal (design, method statement, programme)
	- Compliance of requirements
- See 1.2.3 for D&B

### Tenderers to input different contract period *(2006 Q2C)*

- Difference in various times for completion in tenders can be capitalized by the rate of LAD in the tender, assuming <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD</mark> represents the genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss of each day's delay
- The longer periods can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">converted into a hypothetical value to be added to the tender sum</mark> for comparison with other tender amounts

## Disqualification

- Reason
	- Late submission
	- Non-compliance with requirement, qualification
	- Incomplete submission
	- Misrepresentation
	- Failure to meet tenderer requirement
		- Financial instability, poor past performance
		- Legal issues, conflict of interest
	- Collusion or corruption

## Special Scenario

### Tenderer propose alternative in site layout *(2015 D1Q2a)*

- Although it is often specified in the tender doc that tenderer's proposal site layout plan will be for reference only and shall not override the tender doc, and it if often that the LOA will declare that the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">proposed site layout plant will not form part of the Contract</mark>. Significant <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviation</mark> of the proposed site layout plan from tender doc requirements should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">addressed, and clarification of the cost and time effects</mark> of the removal of the deviation should be made with the tenderer to avoid argument.
- B has inserted a saving in tender sum build-up, which amounted to a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">qualification</mark> of tender.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Clarification</mark> should be obtained from B as to:
	- (1) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Who would take up the design and statutory submission</mark> responsibilities in case its proposal is accepted by Employer? Whether the full <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost and time effects</mark> of its proposal on the Works including consequential changes to the Works due to its proposal have been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">considered in the tender sum</mark>? 
		- Bonus for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">associated cost</mark> including professional fees for preparation of necessary submissions, additional temporary works such as diversion of utilities, tree protection or transplanting, site security, cleaning, etc.
	- (2) What would be the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time and cost implications if its proposal is rejected</mark> by Government authorities? Would the Employer only be liable for $200,000 being the saving previously offered?
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If it is considered that B's proposal has no merit or very little chance</mark> of success, then probably only (2) would be necessary.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If it is considered that the qualification should not be considered</mark> whatsoever irrespective of any potential merit, B should be told that its proposal has amounted to a qualification and the qualification should be withdrawn without adjustment to the tender sum or completion time. 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If B's proposal is considered to have merit and has good chance </mark>of success, and if this is not considered to be a qualification which has to be rejected whatsoever, then it may be worthwhile to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ask other tenders for the cost and time implications</mark>. However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design and statutory submission responsibilities should be clearly stated</mark> because this will not be a tenderer's proposal from the other tenderers' perspective. The answers can be treated as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">post contract variation</mark> without now changing the tender sum.
- Bonus to mention <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">fairness</mark>
	- Tenderer's technical submission are to demonstrate their technical capability and competence to complete the works. In fair tendering, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not appropriate</mark> to request the other tenderers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adopt other's technical proposal and revise tender sum</mark>. This should be the case especially if the technical proposal involves special intellectual thoughts. However, since B has qualified his tender, unless his qualification is withdrawn, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accepting his qualified tender without giving a chance to other</mark> tenderers to quote would also be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unfair</mark>.

### Tenderer's proposed specialist not on list *(2015 D1Q2b)*

- Proposed specialist not on list
- It should first be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">checked whether</mark>
	- The tender doc have stated that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the recommended list is a restrictive list</mark> meaning that the tenderer would not be allowed to proposed others not on the list
	- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviation would amount to a disqualification</mark> of the tender
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the deviation would amount to a disqualification</mark> of the tender, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender cannot be considered</mark> further 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the tender will not be disqualified right away, but the list is restrictive</mark>, the tenderer should be asked to adjust and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">choose from the list at no change to the rest of the tender</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the Employer wishes to relax in respect of the restrictive list or disqualification</mark>,<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> other tenderers should be given a chance</mark> to propose others not on the list
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the list is not restrictive</mark>, then it is up to the consultants and the Employer to consider <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the proposed sub-contractor is acceptable</mark> or not, and there is no need to give other tenderers another chance
	- It would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be good to disapprove the proposed sub-contractor in the post contract stage</mark> because the tenderer's prices and quality of the curtain wall will very much depend on the sub-contractor chosen, so the acceptability should be considered now.
	- Prior to any assessment of proposed sub-contractor, H should be requested to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">give reasons for not using the recommended</mark> sub-contractors given in the tender documents. The reasons may include:
		- High pricing by the recommended sub-contractors
		- No quotation was received from the recommended sub-contractors
		- Poor relations with the recommended sub-contractors in past projects
		- Heavy workload of the recommended sub-contractors
		- Better price, quality and past long term relationship with the proposed sub-contractor
	- H should also be requested to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">submit sub-contractor's background</mark>, project team, past project experience, recognized trade license and other relevant qualifications for review by the consultants and the Employer. In case the curtain wall is considered to be very important, H's proposed sub-contractor could be asked to demonstrate his understanding of the design requirements and any other key issues relevant to the project.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If there is sufficient evident that H's proposed sub-contractor is not capabl</mark>e of carrying out the specialist work, H should be requested to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">choose</mark> a sub-contractor from the recommended list and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stand by his tender sum</mark>, or face disqualification of his tender.

### Tenderer propose Rate-only Schedule for abortive work *(2015 D1Q2c)*

- Rate-only Schedule for abortive work
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Rate-only schedule</mark> is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">good tool for cost control</mark>. It will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enhance the efficiency</mark> in valuation of abortive work and settlement of final account. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">how extensive the schedule should be</mark> would depend on the likelihood of the abortive work occurring. 
	- In many projects, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">abortive work</mark> is unavoidable. The abortive work caused by the Contractor, usually due to poor materials and workmanship, will have to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">borne by Contractor</mark>. The abortive work to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">borne by Employer</mark> is usually caused by late change of design.
	- It would take <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">additional time for the preparation of the schedule, subsequent analysis and clarification with the tenderers</mark>. If the rates quoted are too high, time would be needed to conduct negotiation. If the tenderers stand firm, the Employer may have to accept because of the limited time to award the contract. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if the abortive work is valued as and when it arises</mark>, there would be ample time to check and agree the prices.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">For organisations which do not adopt the practice of tender negotiation</mark>, the freedom will be limited, because the pricing of the schedule may be regarded as providing a room to make good the tender sums already submitted.
	- Whether the schedule should be prepared should take the above into consideration.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If decided to be issued</mark>, instead of a schedule of items initiated by G, such schedule should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prepared by QS</mark> in conjunction with other consultants.
		- Where practicable, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">typical details and specification</mark> relevant to the common items in connection with abortive work should be given
		- Measurement method and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preambles</mark> notes should be given'
		- The item descriptions should specify the range of quantities within which the rates are still <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">applicable</mark> to cater to the possibility that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantities can vary significantly</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Issue the same schedule to all</mark> lowest three as PTQ would enable a comparative check on the reasonableness of the prices, and see whether the order of the tenders would be changed
		- Provide provisional quantities in the schedule will have the merit of giving an indication of the probable extent of the work for better pricing. However, as the exact extent of abortive work is not known at this stage, if the pro qty is found to be seriously out of order, the Contractor may still argue that the variance in the actual extent should warrant a re-rating. It may therefore be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">simpler just to ask for rates without qty</mark>, while approximate qty are only used for internal pricing comparison.

### Front loading 

- Front loading
	- Early-stage items are priced significantly higher than market norms, while later-stage items are priced low or even marginal
- Not a disqualifying factor
- Risk to Employer
	- Overpayment at early stage, and less payment in later stage
	- Cash flow imbalance, give contractor a financial advantage
	- Reduce Employer leverage for underperformance or early termination
	- VO rate based on high / low contract rate
- TQ to tenderer
	- Confirm to have full understanding of drawings and specification
	- Confirm to bind by tender rates and tender sum without adjustment
	- Assessed rate for VO
	- Reasons for the unbalanced rate
- Employer may consider 
	- Other payment mechanism, e.g. stage payment, limit cap for front-end loading
	- Rejecting the tender on the grounds of commercial risk and lack of transparency
