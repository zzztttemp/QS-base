## Types of Tendering

- Open tendering
	- Allow all interested contractors to submit tenderer, including a new or unknown company
	- Application
		- Notice of invitation placed in mass media like newspaper, trade journals, websites, government gazette
		- Commonly used in public sector
	- Advantages
		- Maximum competition
		- No tender list or approved list of tenderers, which does not allow favoritism
		- Prevent bidders from colluding 勾结
		- Tenderers are not invited and therefore all tenderers should be genuinely interested
		- Allow unknown contractors to tender for the work
	- Disadvantages
		- High cost of tendering; huge administrative work to handle a potentially large number of tender bids
		- More time required to evaluate the tenders
		- An incompetent or unsuitable contractor may be chosen
		- Low chance for contractor to be successful due to high competition
- Selective tendering
	- Tender is opened to an approved list of contractors
	- Application
		- Commonly used in private sector
		- Shortlist contractors based on pre-qualification
	- Single-stage v two-stage
		- Single stage
			- Most popular
		- Two stage
			- For D&B to allow contractor's design at the early stage
			- First stage: Initial bids based on outline design
				- For selection of contractor and establish a level of pricing
			- Second stage: Contract works with project team to develop the design and price the works in detail
	- Advantages
		- The risk of awarding the contract to a non-qualified contractor is lower than in an open tender
		- Time and cost required to prepare and evaluate the tender is less
		- Lower opportunity cost to tenderers due to relatively low competition
	- Disadvantages
		- New bidders who may offer more innovative / competitive proposal are excluded
		- Prices may be higher compared with open tender for less competitiveness
		- Higher possibility on collusion if the firms get to know the probable list of tenderers in the area
	- Advantages for two-stage only
		- Early appointment of contract which leads to shorter project duration
		- Contractor's input in design to improve buildability
		- Collaboration between contractor and design team is enhanced
	- Disadvantages for two-stage only
		- Preferred contractor's role in design development strengthens its negotiation position in the second-stage tender which may result in a difficult bargain on the Employer side
- Negotiated contracts / single tendering
	- Only one tenderer is invited to submit tender, client negotiate directly with a chosen contractor
	- Application
		- In extreme urgency like restoration of works after unforeseeable events
		- Good relationship & previous projects with the chosen contractor; extension of previous contract
		- When copyrights or patented works are involved
		- When specialised service or equipment must be procured to meet certain compatibility or specification requirement
		- When lease terms for occupation require the work to be carried out by a particular company, e.g. maintenance contractor
	- Advantages
		- Shorter tendering period; reduce administrative works
		- Capability of the contractor is secured
		- Continuity of work can be allowed in case of extension contract
		- Develop good relationship & coordination to eliminate claims during contract
		- Abortive tendering cost to the contractor is minimal
	- Disadvantages
		- No competition is available and there is a risk of higher prices
		- Difficult to check whether the bid received is competitive or not for Employer
		- Difficult to satisfy the test of public accountability especially when public fund is involved
		- Loss of time if the negotiations are unsuccessful
- Serial contracting
	- Contractor undertakes a series of similar projects
	- Contractor is chosen for the for the first phase by means of selective competitive tendering. The accepted tender forms the basis for the second and later phases. 
	- Advantages
		- It provides the benefits of continuity. The contractor for the first phase will have his site organization set up on site, allowing a smooth transition with less additional cost
		- Contractor's workforce will be familiar with the details of the construction increasing the efficiency 
- Design and build
- Joint venture
	- Where projects are so complex that the distribution of liability becomes a problem
	- All parties to the Joint Venture agreement taking on joint and several liability for the design and/or execution of the project
	- Might set up a special joint venture company

## Measures to Prevent Tender Decline & Withdrawal *(2001 Q2) (2016 D1Q4)*

- Tenderers' <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">declining</mark> to tender
	- Enquire prospective tenderers before tendering for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expression of interest</mark> in tendering
	- Provide more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information</mark> of project and contract during the enquiry to enable the prospective tenderers to make decision to tender
	- Do not include usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">harsh contract terms</mark>
	- Give advice of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no prejudice to future tendering</mark> prospect if declining the invitation
	- Given <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">warning of bad records</mark> if declining to tender after accepting the invitation
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tenderers to give early reply</mark> if they really cannot tender after invitation
	- Give sufficient length of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tendering period</mark>
	- Do not require tenderers to incur excessive <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tendering costs </mark>such as requiring them to measure BQ for complex projects
	- Require higher <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender deposites</mark> which will be forfeited if genuine tenders are not submitted after collection of the tender documents
	- Include <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sufficient number of tenderers</mark> just in case some may decline
- Tenderer's <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">withdrawing</mark> tenders
	- Tender information to be kept strictly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">confidential</mark> to avoid leakage of information
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bid bond</mark> to be submitted
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Deposit</mark> by tenderers of cash security, in lieu of a bid bond
	- Tender as a firm standing offer which cannot be withdrawn, possibly with a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nominal consideration</mark> given by the Employer, e.g. one-dollar consideration
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender negotiation changing</mark> the original tender requirements to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">avoided</mark> as it may amount to a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">counter-offer</mark> which may invalidate the bid bond or firm standing offer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender assessment period to be kept as short</mark> as possible
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Desirability of heavy penalty</mark>
	- Tenderers should be looking for business. They <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">must have genuine reasons</mark> if they chose to decline or withdraw. The reasons might be due to sudden change in workload, financial capability, resources and underpricing
	- Heavy penalty with a view to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">force unwilling or incapable</mark> contractors to take up the contract will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">create problems with post contract</mark>
	- Tenderers will quote <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cover prices </mark>more often when faced with heavy penalty

## Employer's & Tenderer's Obligation

- Employer and tenderer enter into an implied contract
	- Sometimes, Employer would like to pay tenderer a token amount (symbolic sum of money, something of value) to confirm the existence of a binding agreement
- Employer's obligation
	- Tenderer who submits a tender in the correct form has a contractual rights to have tender opened and considered
	- Employer shall evaluate and select tender in accordance with COT
- Tender's obligation
	- Not withdraw prior to the expiry of validity period
	- Withdrawal of the offer before the period is a breach of contract

## Bid Rigging

- Types of bid-rigging
	- Bid suppression: one more more competitors agree not to bid or withdraw
	- Cover bidding: certain bidders agree to submit bids with higher prices or unacceptable terms than bid of the designated winner
	- Bid rotation: competitors agree to take turns at being the winning bidder on a serious of contracts
	- Agreement to subcontract to the losing bidders
	- Minimum bidding prices and other methods of reducing competition: bidders agree minimum bidding prices or compensate losing bidders
- Preventive Measures
	- Pre-qualification: Vet contractors' background, ownership structure, and past behavior.
	- Tender design: Avoid predictability; vary selection criteria and deadlines.
		- Include clauses allowing disqualification for collusion.
		- Right to terminate if corruption is proven.
	- Bid conditions: Include anti-collusion declarations.
	- Confidentiality: Keep bid details secure to prevent leaks.
	- Split packages: Reduce incentive for large-scale collusion.
	- Use independent QS/auditor for tender reviews.
- Detection of bid-rigging
	- Similar bid amounts or patterns.
	- Same handwriting or formatting.
	- Unusual subcontractor overlaps.
	- Contractors taking turns to "win".
- Actions if suspect
	- Investigate internally.
	- Report to Competition Commission (in HK) or relevant authority.
	- Reject suspicious tenders.
	- Consider retendering with tighter controls.

## Award + Post-Admin v Re-Tender

### Award + Post-Admin Mitigation

- SA
- Re-sequence
- Delay recovery
- Agree prolongation before award

### Time & Cost Comparison *(2021 D1Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Scenario 1: award then solve in post contract</mark>
	- In a nutshell, contract awarded with site possession subsequently delayed would lead to:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT, L&E</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Determination</mark> if the delay is more serious than specified
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Relationship turning sour</mark> from day one if financial compensation not settled
	- SFBC clauses area
		- Cl.23.1(1)
		- Cl.25.3(j)(i)
		- Cl.27.1(2)(e)(k)
		- Cl. 36.1(1)(d)
	- Bonus: it is possible under SFBC that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">start date of the contract period is earlier or later than the site possession date</mark>. In the former case, there should be a specified or reasonable time gap between the contract award date and the site possession date. A delay to the site possession date beyond the time gap should be critical. In the later case, the delay to the site possession date<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> may or may not be critical</mark> depending on the work possibly carried out before the start of the contract period. A delay beyond the original start date of the contract period should be critical
	- Bonus: while the period of EOT may be easy to determine, it may not be easy and ready enough to ascertain and agree with Contractor the financial compensation or damages resulted from suspension, prolongation and inflation. The relationship between Employer and Contractor may turn sour from the very beginning of the Contract, and this would be detrimental to the smooth running of the Contract.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Scenario 2: retender later</mark>
	- Bonus: usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no compensation needs to be made to the present tenderers if the tendering is terminated</mark>
	- Engagement of the Contractor and the construction of the works will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delayed much longer</mark> than Scenario 1 with consequential loss to client's future income.
	- Client will have to bear the risks of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender price fluctuation</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Preferred tenderer may no longer be competitive in the retender</mark>
	- Client will have to bear the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costs of retender including but not limited to consultancy fees, administration costs</mark>, etc.
	- Bonus: however, on the positive side, the preferred tenderer my just be the best one out of the existing tenderers. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Additional tenderers</mark> and perhaps better tenderers may be invited to the retendering
	- Also, the time delayed can be taken to supplement or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">correct any inadequacies</mark> in the original design and tender documents, and to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">catchup with any new market trends</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Comparison between the two</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time</mark>
		- For the time implication of Scenario 1, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">estimated delay</mark> will be at least 2 months up to 6 months or even more with no guarantee. The delay may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mitigated if the Contractor takes the time pending statutory approval to carry out such preliminary work</mark> as planning, engineering, statutory submission, procurement of plant and materials
		- Scenario 2 will need <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra time of 2-3 months for</mark> inviting tenders, tendering, tender analysis, and award over the delay under Scenario 1 if, as the question says, "retender when the statutory approval is obtained"
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If determination occurs, the delay will be much more serious</mark> than the extra 2-3 months required by Scenario 2. The full impact will depend on the time of determination and the subsequent actions by both parties.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost</mark>
		- For the cost implications in case of no determination, both Scenario 1 & 2 should in theory by subject to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same inflationary increase</mark> for the period until the site possession date, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Scenario 2 should have more due to the longer delay</mark>. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if the market price is decreasing</mark> or the tenderers become more competitive, there can be a chance of lowered prices in case of Scenario 2.
		- Scenario 1 will attract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolongation and disruptive costs</mark> if some work is carried out before site possession. Contractor may not be able to control his subcon or supplier's prices in case of Scenario 1 to be in line with the general inflationary increase. The handling of the cost claims will be difficult. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost implication of Scenario 1 are less predictable</mark>.
		- In case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determination</mark> under Scenario 1, the financial compensation to the Contractor can be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">huge amount</mark> covering at least the loss of profits which may be earned from this Contract.
		- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">consultants will incur additional costs due to abnormal nature</mark> of the delayed site possession, the contractual administration complications so induced in Scenario 1, the extra services required for retendering in Scenario 2, and the longer service period in both scenarios. Additional fees would be required depending on the terms of the consultancy appointment.
		- Bonus: in view of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uncertainty of the financial</mark> implications and compensation which may be made, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sour working relationship</mark> so created, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Scenario 1 is worse than Scenario 2</mark>.
