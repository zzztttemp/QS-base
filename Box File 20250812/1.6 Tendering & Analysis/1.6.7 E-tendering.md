## Consideration

- Requirement
	- Both parties have the software required and understand the procedures
	- Whole procedure shall ensure convenience, openness and continuity
		- Convenience: streamlined procedures to distribute
		- Openness: can be processed by using common hardware without need to invest in specialised equipment
		- Continuity: smooth transition from the old system
- Advantages (2000 Q 1.3)
	- Procedure for tender document distribution & tender preparation will be streamlined
		- Tenderers do not have to re-type the documents, and can use files directly for pricing
	- Increase productivity and save operational cost
	- Increase local construction industry competitiveness
	- Environmental friendly
		- Less number of hard copies
	- Facilitated QS checking using priced computer files
- Disadvantages (2000 Q 1.3)
	- Easy for other people to use information on the files for other use
	- Intellectual property right weakened
	- One more task of distributing soft copies introduced
	- Control must be taken to ensure soft copies to be same as hard copies for both tender out and return
	- Rules must be set up to determine precedence of documents in case of discrepancies

## Pre-requisite *(2005 Q2B)*

- Initial investment in setting up the hardware and software, including server
- Establish clear and accountable procedures for operation of the system to maintain its integrity, reliability and confidentiality
- On-going maintenance, both hardware and programme updating
- Training in-house and all stakeholders e.g. contractors, consultants and clients
- Clearance of legal aspects - basis of tender in case of dispute, ownership of server in case an external IT consultant is engaged for the system

## Reason why not widely adopted *(2005 Q2B)*

- Culture barrier - most senior management would prefer hard copies to electronic documents
- Lack of confidence - hackers tampering with the system, confidentiality of tender sum and other information submitted
- Design input by contractor in electronic form, particularly in D&B tenders, offers little comfort to contractors for copyright infringement 
- Lack of training
- Lack of support from government and from developers
- No tangible benefit readily seen by most stakeholders
- Technology barrier - electronic transmission within a very short time prior to tender receipt of large volume of information often lead to system failure
- Lack of incentive to invest in initial cost and training dur to downturn of construction volume
- HK's relatively compact CBD renders delivery of hardcopies and documents relatively cheap and speedy

## User requirement *(2021 D1Q4)*

- Functionality and efficiency
	- Shorten the overall time spent on the tendering process 
	- Issue tender documents and accept tender submission electronically
	- User-friendly interface for tenderers to input their pricing / data
	- Make use of existing practice, e.g. convert BQ in spreadsheet format to the desired format before tender issuance and upon submission
	- Generate tender (and addendum) issuance letter
	- Handle addenda without the need for replacing the whole set of documents
	- Handle submission documents other than BQ/SOR (e.g. Form of Tender, tenderers' qualifications, other documents required to be submitted)
	- Report missing inputs or unsolicited additions and alterations
	- Check calculations, collections and summaries
	- Produce basic tender analysis tables
	- Fill in tender report templates
	- Output all data to commonly used file formats for other tasks
	- Generate elemental cost analysis
	- Build up databank
	- Trace error easily
	- Streamline workflow, i.e. less setting, less user interfaces
	- Integrate with the taking off and bill production processes 
- System performance
	- Reliability of tender submission process - sufficient bandwidth, proper time stamp
	- System safety - reliable high-level IT security (e.g. firewall, anti-virus, anti-hijacking mechanism)
	- Access right control - authorized persons only, with well-defined privilege hierarchy structure
	- Trackable control - access log to record who, when, where and what about the persons and activities inside the system, in particular data transmission to and from tenderers
	- Compliance with privacy policy
	- Confidentiality - stringent control on retrieving, viewing, editing and downloading
	- Geographical location of vendor's servers to be free of interference, if cloud platform is used
	- Vendor's capability, reputation and experience to be good
	- System uptime and connection stability
	- Protection from being edited by tenderers to be provided
	- Insurance indemnity to be provided
	- Measured to reduce risks of discontinuity of the system by the vendor
- Operability
	- Easy to use - no special IT skill is needed
	- Safe data backup mechanism
	- Easy to convince the clients to use
	- Easy to learn - short training period, or full online training sessions and manuals
	- Easy to upgrade - requires lesser administrative approvals and IT support
	- Downward compatible - new version can operate old projects and data
	- Data can be read and stored outside the vendor's system, in particular by those employers who may not or do not want to have access to the vendor's system
	- Real time monitoring of the tendering process, e.g. who have received/submitted, what have been received/submitted
	- 24/7 technical support
	- Facilitate technical check and monitoring by supervisors who are not familiar with the system
- Affordability
	- Low investment costs (e.g. licences & hardware)
	- Low running and upgrading costs (2/g/ licensing & hardware)
	- Minimal technical (QS) skill
	- Minimal human resources for startup (e.g. training and adaptation to new system)
	- Minimal resources upon upgrade (e.g. IT support, impact on existing projects)
	- Minimal impact upon discontinuity of the system (e/g/ date can be edited by other software
