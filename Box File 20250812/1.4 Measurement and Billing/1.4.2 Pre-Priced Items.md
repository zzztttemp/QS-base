## Concept

- PC sum
	- A sum for works or services to be executed by NSC or for materials to be obtained from NS
	- Deemed to be exclusive of contractor's profit & attendance 
	- Purpose
		- To give the Architect control over the choice to firm to carry out the work / supply of material, particularly where it is of a specialist nature or outside the scope of work normally carried out by general contractors 
	- Basis of amount
		- Estimate or tendered sum
	- Contractor's profit & attendance to PC sum
		- Profit as percentage - adjust on a pro-rata basis
		- Attendance usually as lump sum - not adjustable

- Pro sum
	-  a sum for work or for cost which cannot be entirely foreseen, defined or detailed at the time of tender
	- Pro sum for contingencies
		- To offset costs of undefined work which cannot be foreseen before construction begins and which may not arise at all

- PC rate
	- For the material cost of items or are for the supply and installation of items (e.g. engineering wood, kitchen cabinet)
	- A nominal rate given by Employer and to be adopted by the tenderers in their marking up of the all-in rate for that specified item. 
	- Adjustment of PC rate item in Preambles
		- Adjusted by the nett difference between the PC rate and actual price and will be applied to the nett quantity measured
		- No adjustment o rate for profit and wastage; or
		- Pro-rate basis

- Pro item
	- An item of work identified as provisional to be carried out by Contractor if instructed by Architect
- Pro qty
	- An estimated quantity of work identified as provisional, where the actual quantity could not be accurately determined when the BQ were prepared, to be carried out by Contractor if AI
## PC Rate Item 

- If price is lower than PC rate
	- Private: agree reasonable rates, and treated as similar to arithmetical error
- Two part
	- Adjustable PC supply rate, supply to site only
	- Non-adjustable rate for installation, profit, wastage
- P.C. rate for SOR
	- Issue: qty not binding
	- Need to state in preamble that the qty is deemed to be used for P.C. rate adjustment purpose and for that purpose only
- Good practice
	- Make reference to Cost Plan / quotation
	- Discuss with Architect & Engineer
	- Backup calculation and source of information
	- Obtain approval from Client

### Information to be obtained from supplier (2004 Q2D)

- The information from supplier to architect could be very preliminary and indicative
- To avoid a large divergence between the actual supply rate and the PC rate used, the following information should be clarified with the supplier:-
	- Whether the supply rate is inclusive of 
		- Cutting the granite cladding to size
		- Cutting and forming bevelled edges, curve, and associated polishing
		- Cutting of fixing pockets / slots
		- Matching shades, hues and pattern as the sample supplied to the Architect
		- Sealer to surface of the granite cladding
	- The joint width allowed (affect actual qty for large areas)
	- Finance charges for the supplier to meet the payment terms of MC
	- Freight charges
	- Special conditions and terms of payment 
	- Whether rate is inclusive of any custom clearance, royalties and duties
	- Supplier's responsibility for the delivery to site, including unloading to the street level of the site
	- Returning packing materials and payment of transport charges
	- Unit rates for additional qty that may need to be ordered for wastage, maintenance or defects rectification during and after the DLP

## Application of pro qty *(2009 D1Q3)*

- Circumstances
	- When the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design of the works had not yet been fully developed</mark> by the design team at the time of preparing of tenders. The details of design available are insufficient to measure firm quantities
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design changes are anticipated</mark> due to uncertain site / ground condition, user's requirements
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design alternatives are under consideration</mark> by the design team or Employer
	- When there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insufficient time for QS to measure</mark>
- Pro qty serve to provide an indication of the scope and nature of works to facilitate tender comparison and will provide a set of contract rates for payment and final account. All pro qty will be subject to re-measurement upon finalization of design.
- Example
	- Site investigation or ground investigation works, which are subject to the actual site / ground condition
	- Piling works, which are normally subject to actual founding levels before the pile lengths can be determined
	- Site formation works, which are normally subject to the actual topographical survey
	- Reinforcing bars, where are subject to detailed structural design
	- Finishing works where Employer wants to have a choice between alternatives
	- Underground drainage works, which are subject to the actual site condition
	- Builder's works in connection with building services installation, which are subject to the finalized combined services drawings
	- External works which are subject to detailed design at a later stage of a project
	- Repairing spalling concrete at existing buildings, the extent of which is to be ascertained after commencement of works

## Contingency

- Usually allow 5-10% contingency as Pro Sum
- Estimating using Risk Analysis (ERA)
	- Use cost x possibility % of potential risks to determine the contingency
