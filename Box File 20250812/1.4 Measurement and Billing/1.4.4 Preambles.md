### Reasons & concern on deviation from SMM (2004 Q2A)

- Reason
	- In line with the trade practice that the item is manufactured and priced in sets
	- Trade practice for QS
	- Avoid missing out sundry components
	- Eliminate errors in quantification
	- Simplify the measurement, remeasurement, variations and final account
	- To suit the problem that drawings usually do not have such details
	- Percentage deviation in measurement is small and insignificant
- Concern
	- No detailed breakdown / rate to facilitate valuation of variations of the components within the composite item
	- Some item is cost significant
- Improvement
	- Include PC rates for the more cost significant items to facilitate future changes
	- Request a breakdown of the composite rate for purpose of future payment valuation and variations

### Criteria when simplifying the measurement rules in SMM (20024 Q2B)

- Speeding up the measurement time for those relatively cost insignificant items
- Speeding up the tender estimation / pricing time in providing a realistic price
- Conforming to the trade practice of manufacturing or pricing
- Reducing risk of claims and disputes
- Overcoming deficiencies contained in design information or resolving practical problems in assessment or remeasurement of final account
- Item to be included in the composite rate would preferably be inferred from the quantity of the main item
- The transfer of risks of items not measured can be reasonably allowed by C's estimator and included in his rates for the principal items
- After simplifying the standard rules, there should be mechanisms to allow the establishment of cost bases for future assessment of variations
- The intention and simplified rules must be clearly given in a preamble clause
