## Quantity for Estimate

- Significant cost parameters
    - CFA
        - All area at all floor levels measured to the outside face of the external walls
        - Podium area = Site Area x Site Coverage x Floors
        - CFA = GFA x factor
        - Super-highrise: higher for refuge floor, more lifts with larger lift lobby *(1999 Q1)*
        - Include: balcony, covered functional area
        - Exclude: bay window, canopy
        - Sloping surface measured as flat
    - GFA
        - GFA = Site Area x Plot Ratio
        - Plot ratio

        - Exemption
            - Light well, staircase, lift shaft, flat roof, private carpark, cladding, AC platform, balcony, precast wall panel, machine room, refuge floor, recreational areas in residential development, etc.
        - GFA x factor = CFA
    - Green features that may be exempted from GFA
	    - Balcony, utility platform, wider common corridors and lift lobby
	    - Communal sky garden, communal podium garden
	    - Acoustic fins, sunshades and reflectors, noise barrier
	    - Application

## Factors Affecting Accuracy

- Completeness of client's brief
- Availability of information
- Change to design
- Site conditions
- Market condition
- Method of estimate
- Uniqueness of project
- Availability of cost date
- Experience of estimator
- Contractual arrangement

## Example

### Elemental cost from benchmark project *(2006 Q1A)*

- CFA schedule
	- CFA to GFA ratio extracted from benchmark project
	- Assume M&E floor, CFA pro rata from benchmark project
	- Assume 1 storey for loading and unloading 
	- Carpark area per lot from benchmark project
	- Work out basement storey number
- Elemental cost summary
	- Price adjustment
		- TPI adjustment
			- Foundation & ELS earlier than MC
			- Different for building and E&M portion
			- Forecast future periods
		- Consider substantial market change of concrete and rebar prices
	- Quantity adjustment
		- Most adjusted based on CFA
		- Vertical element to be adjusted for building height
		- Foundation element to be adjusted based on total CFA
		- Basement structure element to be adjusted based on basement CFA
	- Site adjustment
		- Allowance for demolition, asbestos removal & diversion of existing services
		- Subject to checking with structural engineer for subsoil information and likely foundation depth
- Exclusion list

### Checklist when using similar benchmark project for land bid *(2010 D1Q1A)*

- Check the arithmetic
- Check the relationship between GFA and CFA
- Adjust for the differences in GFA and CFA between two sites
- Caution whether every functional area is to be proportionally adjusted or the clubhouse area can remain the same
- Adjust for the price level differences
- Check whether the price indices are up to date
- Project the latest price indices if not released
- Check against the cost per floor area of other projects to see whether the adjustment from past data is out of order

### TPI limitation and reason for deviate *(2017 D1Q3)*


- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Purpose and limitation</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">TPI</mark> are often compiled by government departments and QS consultants based on data collected from tenders. The targeted sector varies from index series to index series. Indices <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complied by government departments often focus on public works while indices complied by QS consultants often focus on private sector</mark>. Most of the TPIs published by QS consultants measure tender price movements of a fixed quantified list of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">notional builder's works items which are typical</mark> to building construction projects, and may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exclude certain building elements</mark>, e.g. piling, substructures, external works and mechanical & electrical services
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Factors reflected by TPI</mark>
		- General fluctuations of common materials, labour and plant costs
		- Trend of risks allocation between contractors and employers
		- Competition among contractors
	- However, since the quantified list is fixed, TPIs generally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">do not reflect changes in design standards</mark> and provisions of the building occurring after the Base Year of the respective index in response to the property market.
	- Even if TPI has been compiled very responsive to changes in the design standards and provisions, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a single TPI covering all building types</mark> would only represent the weighted average of all building types. Because of the different choices of design standards and provisions, the unit construction costs of different building types are different, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changes of the unit construction costs of different building types over time are different</mark>. Some unit construction costs will change more rapidly than the averaged TPI while other unit construction costs will fall behind.
	- TPI is just an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aid to indicate the general average trend of tender price level changes of all building types</mark>. It would be useful to serve as an economic <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">indicator and for making minor adjustment</mark> due to change in time to costs already estimated on a more solid basis for estimating purposes. TPIs are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on historical tender prices</mark> which trend may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not necessarily apply to the future</mark>.
	- Even the unit construction cost for a particular building type is also an average of that particular building type, and should not directly be applied to a particular building
	- The actual cost of a building will depend upon the design, site conditions and many other factors relevant to that particular building. The more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">solid cost estimate should be based on the building itself rather than</mark> relying on the published TPI or unit construction cost for that building type.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reason for residential unit construction cost rising more rapidly than the TPI </mark>
	- Increasing tendency of developers <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uplifting the design standards</mark> and provisions of private residential buildings in the past decade:
		- Increased floor-to-floor height
		- Adoption of curtain wall system and glazed screen
		- Heavy use of natural stone finishes
		- Luxurious provision of kitchen appliances
		- Luxurious provision of sanitary fittings and wares
		- Sophisticated clubhouse design, etc.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BEAM Plus</mark> certification
	- Mandatory implementation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Building Energy Codes</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Enhanced fire services provisions</mark> required by latest Code of Practice / Circular Letters
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Enhanced site safety, environmental management and site hygiene</mark> provisions
