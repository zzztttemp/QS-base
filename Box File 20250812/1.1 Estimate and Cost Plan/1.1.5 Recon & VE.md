    - Original estimate
    - New estimate
    - Addition/omission
        - Effect on Prelim
    - Reason
- Reason for difference between standard budgetary rate v detailed cost estimate
	- Accuracy and basis of data
	- Scope and provisions
		- E.g. foundation, clubhouse, external works, etc.
	- Cost Consideration
		- Development type
		- Project type

		- Contractual
		- Market
- Recon with benchmark approach *(2011 D1Q1)*
	- Pre-condition
		- Check whether the two projects are comparable
	- Identify difference
		- Identify differences in the scope
		- Identify differences in design standards after aligning scope and price levels
		- Identify differences in unit rates after adjusting for TPI
		- Check percentage allowances
	- Justify the differences
	- Make appropriate adjustment of time difference (e.g. adjust for tender price indices)
	- Check further if apparent reasons not sufficient
	- Self check
		- Check arithmetic
		- Bulk check the qty
	- Tabulate a side by side comparison table
	- Check with persons responsible
	- Check files when persons responsible not present


### Standard budgetary rate v Detailed cost estimate _(2001 Q1.1)_

- Accuracy and basis of date
	- Standard budgetary rate
		- Average rate for similar type of building
		- Intended for budgetary indications only
		- Irrespective of location of site
		- Based on normal site conditions, foundations and programmes, etc.
		- Without specific project design details
		- Data based on historic data
		- Published regularly bust usually some time ago
		- Intended to be adjusted for changes in price levels with time
	- Detailed cost estimate
		- Specifically prepared for the project in question
		- With due consideration for the specific details of the project
		- Prepared based on more advanced level of project information
		- Prepared based on approximate quantities with measurement and pricing
		- Based on current market rates
		- Possibly with some built-in buffer for future inflation
		- Therefore more accurate and realistic for future use
- Scope and provisions
	- Standard budgetary rate
		- Include only standard provisions
		- Exclude clubhouse
	- Detailed cost estimate
		- Foundation, height, storey, E&M, finishes and fittings
		- Clubhouse and extensive landscaping works

### Cost plan recon for change *(2008 Q1.1.2)*

- The total cost increase between the two estimates that is approx. (+) $668M. Reasons for the cost increase are: -
	- Tender price increase: increase by 53% between Aug 06 and Aug 08. Even if there were no design changes, this would equate to approx. (+) $592M.
	- Basement carpark (in lieu of open carpark) is added which has caused an increase in foundation cost. The cost increase is approx. (+) $43M is built up as follows:-
		- ![image.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250804210910.png)
	- Changing the single glazed to double glazed curtain wall system. The cost increase is (+) $40M.
	- Open carpark is deleted. Assumed no cost effect as the open space is to be covered with pavement.
	- Proportionate increase in Preliminaries due to the increases above, that is 10% x ($43M + $40M) = $8.3M, say $8M
	- Proportionate increase in Contingencies due to the increases above, that is 5% x ($43M + $40M + $8M) = $4.55M, say (+) $5M
- Total (+) $688M

### Cost plan recon with benchmark *(2011 D1Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Comparability</mark>
	- It should be highlighted that while both projects are for student hostels requiring comparable provisions, KT was a completely new building, and CW involves the conversion of the existing staff quarters.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Scope</mark>
	- CW involves <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">additional scope of works</mark> for demolitions, alterations, jointing between the existing and the new, BMU, site formation and slope stabilization
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Arithmetical check</mark>
	- There should be a statement that arithmetical check has been done. Evidence of the check is not absolutely required
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Comparison table</mark>
	- A comparison table is not absolutely necessary but would help identify areas of differences. Merits should be given if a reasonable comparison table is given
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Difference in price levels</mark>
	- CW is based on 9/2011 without fluctuation.
	- KT is based on 6/2009. 
	- Adjustment should be made to bring the price levels up-to-date using TPI.
- Demolitions
	- CW includes extensive demolitions inside the existing staff quarters.
	- KT is based on new construction with no demolition required.
- Foundations and substructure
	- CW's rate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">indicates piled foundation</mark>. However, there should be savings in using the existing foundations of the staff quarters. The elemental cost/m2 is only a fraction of the current usual element cost/m2.
	- KT's rate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">indicates a shallow footing system. Further check with Employer would be required.</mark>
- Structural frames
	- CW includes extensive alterations to the structural frame of the existing staff quarters to convert it to suit a student hostel. However, it would not be justifiable if the elemental cost/m2 of altering an existing structure should be more than building a new structure, unless historic building preservation is required.
	- KT is based on new construction.
- Roof structure and covering
	- Any attempt should be made to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">convert the elemental cost per CFA to elemental cost per roof area</mark> for both projects for comparison. The presence of the existing roof structure of the staff quarters should also be accounted for
- External walls
	- Any attempt should be made to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">convert the elemental cost per CFA to elemental cost per elevation area</mark> for both projects for comparison. The presence of the existing external walls of the staff quarters should be accounted for. Windows may or may not need to be replaced. 
	- The standards of external finishes and cladding may be difference. The presence of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BMU may indicate</mark> that the external elevations are treated with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">glass or metal cladding</mark>.
- BMU
	- CW allowed for
	- KT not provided
- BS works
	- The number of lifts v the floor area may be a factor causing the cost/m2 difference
- Site formation and external works
	- CW has extensive site formation, slope works and external works allowed
	- KT only has minimal works
- BEAM Plus platinum rating
	- CW allowed for
	- KT not required
- Design and construction contingencies
	- As the elemental cost analysis for KT is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on agreed final accounts</mark>, all variations would have been included in the individual cost items. However, as CW is still <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in the design stage</mark>, it is prudent to leave an allowance for design and construction <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contingencies</mark> to cover change of design requirements, technological changes, and changing market conditions. 

## Value Engineering

- To increase value (function / cost ratio)
    - Not necessarily cost deduction
    - Cost can be non-financial
- Concept of VE _(2001 Q1.3)_
    - To review project-related design issues and compare the cost of such design with the value created to satisfy project objectives
    - Reveal design alternatives which can result in cost saving or designs that may satisfy more than one project objective and create more value
    - The benchmark for comparison of values often relates to cost, however, projects may have multiple objectives including time, phasing, environmental consciousness, costs-in-use, information technology awareness, flexibility in future use and capability for future expansion
- Process of VE _(2001 Q1.3)_
    - Information phase
        - Collect basic design information including design brief, preliminary drawings, site location, access, orientation, associated cost information and user requirements
    - Analysis phase
        - Identify the 'needs' and 'wants' including project objectives
    - Creativity phase
        - Brainstorming session to gather ideas on how the project objectives can be achieved without relating these ideas to the costs
    - Development phase
        - Develop the ideas collected from the creativity phase, assess the feasibility in terms of practicality, building code violation
    - Evaluation and recommendation
        - Evaluate each idea in terms of cost, time for implication, limitations in design
        - Come up with a list of recommended issues for future follow-up action
- Parties _(2001 Q1.3)_
    - Employer, Architect, Structural Engineer, M&E Engineer, Quantity Surveyor, building management team, users
- Role of QS _(2001 Q1.3)_
    - Provide advice on monetary value of design alternative
    - Employer to judge whether the money spent is justified for the value derived from the design alternatives
- Role of facilitator & candidate *(2001 Q1.3)*
	- Allocate sufficient time for each process of VE
	- Encourage the view of all disciplines be represented
	- Candidate
		- Should have the training 
		- No particular discipline
		- QS more suited because QS are cost conscious and all design decisions will have some effect on costs. QS are basically neutral in terms of design preference as long as the design can achieve the most economic outcome. The all-round training of QS enables a wider consideration of the needs of users and operators and will objectively provoke more balanced views from the participants of the VE. 
- General cost saving options
	- Piling - higher concrete grade to reduce rebar cost
	- Decrease floor height - lower wind load, reduce structure & foundation cost
	- Reduce specification of material
		- Material standard
		- BOH area from plaster and paint to paint on concrete
		- Carpark from epoxy paint to no finish
	- MVAC - VRV to replace chiller plant; fan coil unit / VAV unit to replace central A/C
	- Take out and leave works in rental area for tenants

## Implication of Design Change other than Cost *(2007 Q1.1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Design implications</mark>
	- As the project is currently at detailed design stage, changing the car park location constitutes a major change. Substantial <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-design and co-ordination</mark> with different design disciplines will be necessary. This will involve a revised <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BD submission</mark> which will have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time implications</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Programme implications</mark>
	- It would generally be expected to see a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduction in overall project duration</mark> due to eliminating the basement carpark, because the time required to construct the diaphragm walls and the two storey basement is far longer than the time required to construct an extra podium floor
	- The elimination of the basement means that once the foundations are completed, the podium works could be commenced immediately. Hence the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">superstructure works could be commenced earlier</mark> than in the case where the basement is included
	- Eliminating the basement car park will also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">eliminate the risks associated with the ground conditions</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Procurement implications</mark>
	- In the original scheme, it would generally be expected to start the diaphragm wall / basement construction in advance of the superstructure works, leaving more time for the design team to complete the detailed design of the superstructure works. However, with the proposed option, as soon as the foundations are completed, the construction of the superstructure works could commence. This means that the construction of the car park in the podium could be included as part of the overall construction and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design of the superstructure works may need to be advanced to facilitate earlier tendering</mark>.

## VE Scenarios

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A list of assumptions, exclusions and items for clarification is required.</mark>
### Same GFA but super-highrise and less tower no. *(1999)*

- CFA
	- Addition of one level of refuge floor
	- Area of lift lobby - lift no.
- Elemental cost
	- Prelim
		- Efficiency of labour
		- Vertical transportation
		- Scaffolding
	- Piling and foundation
		- Loading requirement, wind load
		- Settlement control
		- No. of tower
	- Structure
		- Concrete volume - load requirement
		- Concrete grade and steel ratio
	- Façade
		- Difficulty of construction
		- Glass thickness - wind load
	- P&D / Gas / FS / EL
		- Larger pipe size for risers at lower floors - support the same flow rate at upper floors
		- Heavier duty valves and accessories - higher working pressure
		- More expensive main and sub-main distribution system - electrical loading
		- Design more advanced and sophisticated
	- Lift
		- Number (no deduction if same no. of flat)
		- Travel distance / lift shaft, speed
	- Roof - lower
		- Same area but no. reduction
	- Landscape
		- External area
- Other pros and cons
	- Pros
		- More open space / landscape area - enjoyment

		- Less input for facility management - less no. of tower
	- Cons
		- Longer construction period - higher finance charger, delay investment return
		- Less usable floor area
		- High maintenance costs to façade
		- Longer waiting time for lifts

### Super-high rise *(1999 Q1)*

- Why higher construction cost?
	- Extra CFA
		- Refuge floor
		- Larger lift lobby for more lifts
	- Higher preliminaries
		- Increased cost and decreased efficiency due to vertical transportation for worker, plant and materials
		- Scaffolding
	- Structure
		- Larger column volume for higher loading requirements
		- Higher grade of concrete and steel ratio
		- If same CFA, super high-rise substructure cost might be lowers because of the reduction of the tower number
	- Facade
		- More difficult to carry out works due to windload
		- Thicker window glass to withstand higher windload
	- E&M
		- Larger pipe sizes for risers at lower floors in order to support the same flow rate at upper floors (PD, FS, Gas)
		- Heavier duty valves and accessories are to be used in connection with higher working pressure (PD, FS, Gas)
		- More expensive main and sub-main distribution system is required as the electrical loading is more divergent from the Main Switch Room (EL)
		- The design is relatively more advanced and sophisticated (All)
		-  Lifts
			- Total distance of travel is loner
			- Faster lifts are required for higher zone
			- No corresponding reduction in the number of lifts
	- Roof
		- If same CFA, might reduce roof CFA
	- Landscaping
		- Additional landscaping works to cover more area
- Pros and cons
	- Advantages
		- More open space or landscaping area at the podium deck for the residents' enjoyment
		- More flats at higher level which can offer better views and, hence, better sale prices
		- Less number of caretakers would be required (3 towers in lieu of 5 towers to be looked after)
	- Disadvantages
		- Longer construction period, finance charges for construction is higher and investment return is delayed
		- Less usable floor area
		- Higher maintenance costs to external walls and windows when scaffolding is required or gondola
		- Longer waiting time for lifts

	- Addition of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">appliances</mark> to serviced apartment - fridge, television sets, hotplates / cooking ranges
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pipe ducts</mark> for mechanical ventilation of toilets / pantry exhaust
	- The need for an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reception area and management office</mark> for the exclusive use of the tenants of the service apartments
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tourist bus lay-by area</mark> for loading / unloading
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Building services</mark> - change in population density and mode will mean changes to the original building services design, including
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Plumbing and drainage</mark> 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pipe sizing and arrangement</mark> (toilet arrangement from centralized as in office to room-by-room in serviced apartments)
		- Addition of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hot water</mark> provision for serviced apartment
		- Revision to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">underground drainage</mark> provisions due to substantial addition of toilets in serviced apartment

	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Town gas</mark> provision in serviced apartment
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Method of cost estimating</mark>
	- On a cost per area basis - e.g. assuming HK$3,000-5,000/m2 for fitting out of the serviced apartment
	- On a cost per unit basis - e.g. assuming HK$15,000-30,000/unit for the provision of sanitary fittings for each toilet
	- On a percentage mark-up of other items - e.g. assuming a revised percentage on BWIC works
	- On the basis of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cost advice from A / SE / BSE</mark> - e.g. a revised lump sum adjustment for the possible revised 24 hour air-conditioning provision on the revised lift arrangement
	- On a presumed measurement basis - e.g. assuming the addition of 6 - 8 doors per unit of serviced apartment - around HK$30,000-40,000 per unit for approx a total of 180 units (with each unit at around 120m2).

### Increase floor height (2004 Q1B)

- Impact on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">structure & foundation</mark> due to increased <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wind loading</mark> as a result of increased height
- Impact on external <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">facade</mark> due to the change in floor height of 3 levels

- Impact on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MVAC</mark> installation due to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increased room volume</mark>
- Impact on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fire services</mark> installation - addition of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sprinkler provisions, fire detection system</mark>, etc., in particular if the increase in depth of suspended ceiling from the structural slab necessitates another layer of sprinklers
- Impact on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">vertical architectural elements</mark> due to the increase in floor-to-suspended ceiling height

### Add indoor swimming pool (2004 Q1B)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Increase floor height</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Add indoor swimming pool</mark>
	- Impact on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">structure and foundation</mark> of the building due to the further increased superimposed <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">load</mark> from the pool
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reduction in the number of guestrooms for accommodation</mark> of the swimming pool
	- Addition of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">swimming pool compound including changing room, pump room, acoustic provision</mark>, etc.

	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Lighting provisions</mark> in the indoor swimming pool area
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Possible glazed enclosure</mark> to the pool area
- Clarify <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">heated pool or cold water-only pool</mark>

### Bonus GFA to add floor or spread to all (2006 Q1B)

- Additional floor option
	- CFA = additional GFA x 1.1
	- Additional lift and E&M cost
	- Additional foundation cost
- Spreading option
	- CFA = additional GFA
	- Additional foundation cost
	- Quantity adjustment to facade and E&M shall be factored down
- Other considerations
	- Longer programme for additional floor option
	- Higher commercial value of the additional areas in the additional floor option because they are on the top of the building
	- Additional floor option will be easier to implement, and should negotiation for bonus GFA be unsuccessful, disruption to the development and construction process can be kept to a minimum
	- Taller buildings will attract higher future maintenance cost
	- Taller building option will yield large podium area for other functional uses
	- Possible re-design fees
	- Building height restriction
	- Additional development fee for planning approval

- Passenger hoist should not be required for tower block of 18 floors but one more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tower crane</mark> may be required for two separate tower blocks
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Site working areas</mark> are required for two separate tower blocks design. Offsite bending yard, relocation of site offices and site storage areas may be required

### Additions to incorporate coaster in shopping mall & actions to ascertain cost *(2005 Q4.B)*

- Impact of the coaster installation on the overall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">structure</mark> of the building 
	- Struct engineer should be ask to check the impact of the added load to the foundation and supporting structure
- Likely <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increase</mark> in insurance premium due to the extensive installation at height 
	- Client's insurer can be approached to advise, alternatively, insurance advisers can be asked to give advice
- Provision of temporary <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">high level erection platform</mark> for installation of shuttle coaster, and any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special hoisting facilities</mark> 
	- Certain local contractors could be consulted for advice, on a without commitment basis
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">permanent maintenance platform</mark>
	- Overseas supplier should be consulted on their experience and their recommendation sought; also the local authorities requirements including those of EMSD should be taken account of
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">emergency escape access route and rescue facilities</mark>
	- Architect and engineer should be advised to approach EMSD with the proposed ride and to enquire their requirements, before any realistic price can be estimated
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">safety net</mark>
	- Same as above
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">storage space for the shuttle coaster</mark>
	- Overseas supplier should be consulted on their experience and their recommendation sought
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">plant room</mark> for the shutter coaster
	- Overseas supplier should be consulted on their experience and their recommendation sough, together with the building service engineer's input
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">control room</mark> for shutter coaster
	- Overseas supplier should be consulted on their experience and their recommendation sought

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Starting-up, recommissioning and testing</mark> of the coaster installation upon substantial completion of the shopping mall

### One block to two slender blocks *(2012 D1Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Effect on foundation and pile caps</mark>
	- The new design will be more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">slender</mark> than the original design and hence <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wind effect</mark> will become more critical in designing the foundations and the building frame. Therefore, 
		- The foundations will have to be strengthened in the new design
		- The structural carcass in the new design will have to be strengthened which in turn will impose a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">greater dead load</mark> on the foundations

### Concrete structure v steel structure based on benchmark *(2018 D1Q2a)*

- Quantity based on Project S structural ratio
	- CFA of Project S
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Slab area + staircase</mark>
	- Concrete
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Exclude substructure works and non-structural walls</mark>
			- Exclude pile caps, ground beams and beds
			- Assume 100mm & 150mm walls are non-structural wall, and exclude
		- Separate ratio for C45 & C60
	- Formwork
		- Exclude formwork for substructure works and non-structural walls
	- Steel bar reinforcement
		- Exclude rebar for substructure works and non-structural walls
		- Assume steel ratio for these elements
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Miscellaneous allow 5%</mark>
	- Rate 
		- Project S rate + TPI not desirable
			- Project S rate may have irregularities due to pricing strategy or project specific issues

- B - steel
	- Steel columns should either be enclosed with fire protection board or coated with fire protection material and enclosed with drywall or cladding. 
	- The structural ratios for the in-situ reinforced concrete option should be based on those of Project S. the structural ratios for concrete work for the composite steel structure option should preferably be by pro-rata from Project S otherwise the differences may not be easily justified.
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of composite steel frame is around 120% higher than the cost of the in-situ reinforced concrete frame</mark>.

### Steel structure indirect impact on cost & procurement *(2018 D1Q2b)*

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Foundation</mark> - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lighter</mark> because the overall building self-weight is lighter
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Walls</mark> - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more non-structural walls</mark> to replace the structural walls outside the core. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">More floor, wall and ceiling finishing areas created due to thinner</mark> walls. Junctions between non-structural walls and partitions with fireproof coated steel column and beams and with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">corrugated metal decking need special treatment</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Columns</mark> - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">smaller</mark> columns. If concrete encased, slight <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increase in areas of floor finishes </mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Metal decking</mark> - the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">interfacing details</mark> between corrugated metal decking and beams or columns and around edges must be carefully thought out before procurement to avoid variations
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Hangers for architectural work and E&M works</mark> - hangers fixed  to steel beams or concrete slabs on steel decks would be by welding or special bolting. Hangers fixed to fireproof coated steel beams would also need <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fireproof coating</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Openings</mark> - openings in steel members must be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed before prefabrication</mark> of the steel members otherwise variation coats would be significant
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Procurement</mark> - steel frame, metal decking and fireproofing would involve additional kinds of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sub-contractors</mark> whether domestic or nominated. Due to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">long lead time</mark> for design, statutory approval and material procurement, the long lead time for design, statutory approval and material procurement, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tendering for steel frames may need to be handled earlier</mark> than the commencement of the superstructure or even the foundations.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design</mark> - the design of the steel frames must therefore be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">frozen very early</mark> for tendering and in any case before prefabrication. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Subsequent design changes are usually costlier</mark> than changes to reinforced concrete structure
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Programme</mark> - pure steel structure should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">faster</mark>, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">concrete core</mark> of composite steel structure and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">concrete casing</mark> to steel columns area <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on the critical path thus making it not must faster</mark>. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Plant</mark> - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special cranes</mark> must be used for the erection of the steel members. They may not be continued to be useful after the erection of the structure

### Combine two floors of office to one floor of exhibition (2024 D1Q1)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Piling and substructure</mark>
	- The foundation design may change as a result of the changes in the total <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dead and live load</mark> as described under "structure" - likely cost increase
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Structure</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">One level of floor slabs and beams</mark> will be omitted to create the double-storey - cost reduction
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Staircases and lift shaft</mark> will be retained - minor cost effect
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Lift shaft and escalator voids</mark> may need to be added - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Column and wall layout</mark> in the new floor will need to be changed, normally to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">longer column and walling space</mark>. A longer span <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">transfer structure</mark> in the form of thicker slab or beam or even using prestressing or post-tensioning may therefore be required to support the upper floors - can be significant cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Floor slab and beams will be strengthened</mark> to take heavier load - cost increase
	- Total required <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loading</mark> capacity may increase to accommodate greater live loads and support heavier equipment - cost increase

	- The design of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">facade to the G/F</mark> may also be upgraded - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Main entrances</mark> will need to be enlarged to accommodate more people flow - cost increase
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Architectural</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">architectural interior</mark> of the two floors of administration offices, e.g. partitions, doors, finishes and office furniture will be omitted - cost reduction
	- In place thereof will be fewer rooms but more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">movable partitions, fewer but heavier doors, more expensive floor, wall and ceiling finishes, more expensive conference and exhibition fixed or loose furniture</mark> - net cost addition after the above cost reduction
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Enlarging and upgrading</mark> of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">entrances / lift lobbies / front of house staircase / toilet</mark> to the new exhibition floor and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">G/F</mark> will be required - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Acoustic treatment</mark> will be required - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Catwalks or steel platform</mark> at floor and high levels for operational and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">maintenance</mark> needs will be required - cost increase
	- Additional <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">signage</mark> will be required - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Kitchen and eating places</mark> may be added - cost increase
	- Retractable or demountable <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seating</mark> may be required - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Additional access to accommodate special guest</mark> may be required - cost increase
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Building Services</mark>
	- MVAC: exhibition hall may require larger MVAC systems with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher cooling capacities</mark> to maintain comfortable temperatures during events. The ventilation systems may also need to handle <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher air exchange rates</mark> - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Acoustic</mark>: ductworks and MVAC system will need to be designed to minimize noise transmission - cost increase
	- Electric power: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher capacity and more flexible and movable power distribution</mark> system will be required - cost increase
	- Lighting - exhibition hall requires <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">flexible lighting systems</mark> to accommodate various event setups and lighting scenarios. This may involve the use of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dimmable lighting fixtures, programmable control systems, and stage lighting equipment</mark> to create different atmospheres and highlight specific areas during events - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Audio-visual system</mark>: exhibition hall has more complex audio-visual requirements compared to typical offices. This includes high-quality sound systems, video projection equipment, screens, microphones, and audio recording capabilities to support presentations, live performances, and multimedia displays - cost increase
	- Exhibition hall may require robust <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">IT and communication infrastructure</mark> to support high-speed internet connectivity, video conferencing, live streaming, and other technological requirements for conferences and events. This may involve dedicated server rooms, network cabling, and audio-visual integration - cost increase
	- Additional <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lift or escalators</mark> may be required - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Plumbing and drainage</mark> system will need to be enhanced to serve more toilets and possibly added kitchens and eating places - cost increase
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">External works</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Access road, carpark and signage</mark> may need to be enhanced to suit more people flow - cost increase
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Capacity of the underground mains</mark> may need to be increase - cost increase
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Preliminaries and contingencies</mark>
	- Corresponding increase - cost increase
