## Overview of Development Stages

- Pre-tender
	- Acquisition of land
	- Evacuation of residents
	- Selection of consultants
	- Design stage
	- Preparation of tender document
- Post-tender
	- Tender period
	- Tender evaluation and award
- Post-contract
	- Anticipated date of commencement
	- Contractor submission of design for approval
	- Review of design
	- Revision of design upon comments
	- BD approval and consent
	- Anticipated ate of possession of site
	- Construction
		- Demolition
		- Piling and foundation
		- Substructure
		- Superstructure
	- Statutory inspection
	- Completion of work
	- DLP

## Overview of Cost Control

- Stages of cost control
	- Setting the budget
	- Cost planning and control of design development
	- Controlling the expenses at the procurement and construction stages

- Types of Employer
	- Occupier (construct to use)
		- Profit obtained indirectly from the benefits derived from activities inside the building
	- Property company (construct to sell)
		- Direct financial profit from development
		- Accuracy of budget greatly affects the profit
	- Investor (construct to rent)
		- Direct financial profit from rental income
		- Accuracy of budget greatly affects the profit
	- Local authority (construct for public use)
		- Must be public accountable for the money spent
		- Profit cannot be valued and can only be assessed by a cost-benefit analysis

## Purpose of Cost Estimate

- Preliminary construction cost indication
- Financial feasibility
- Resource allocation & funding
- Benchmarking for similar projects
- Facilitating decision making of Employer and Design Team
- Setting a limit on expenditure
 
## Estimate in Different Stages

- Inception & Feasibility Stage - Preliminary Cost Estimate
	- Information available
		- GFA, location, prelim site information, required standard
		- Dwg typically not included
    - Cost/CFA * Functional Area CFA + Preliminaries + Contingencies
        - Residential, commercial, office: cost / m2
        - Hotel: cost / room
        - Hospital: cost / bed
        - Theatre: cost / seat
        - Carpark: cost / space

    - To evaluate investment viability & basis of funding
- Outline Proposal Stage - Elemental Cost Estimate
	- Information available
		- Outline schematic drawings with shape and size of the building with minimal layout design
		- Standard required
    - Elemental Cost * Elemental Quantity + Preliminaries + Contingencies
    - ![Exported image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Exported%20image%2020241128145838-0.png)
- Conceptual Design Stage - Detailed Cost Estimate
    - Refined with major elements breakdown
    - ![Exported image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Exported%20image%2020241128145841-1.png)
- Detailed Design Stage - Cost Plan
    - Rate * Approx. Quantity + Preliminaries + Contingencies
    - ![Exported image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Exported%20image%2020241128145844-2.png)
- Tender - Pre-Tender Estimate
    - Price BQ / SOR with prevailing market rates
    - Before tender return
    - To check if within budget
    - To check tender return reasonableness

### Estimate cost of concrete structure update *(2022 D1Q1a)*

- Estimate are prepared very roughly at the very early stage and are to be updated progressively with more accurate methods as the design is developed. The progressive steps are:-
- Analyse the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost per floor area</mark> from past projects, apply <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender price indices to adjust the price levels</mark>, multiply by the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">total floor area</mark>, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">make percentage adjustments for other special factors</mark> like site location, building type and complexity, plan shape, storey and building heights, etc.
- Analyse the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantity factors</mark> (e.g. m3 concrete per floor area, m2 formwork per floor area or m3 concrete, kg reinforcement per floor area or per m3 concrete, etc.) from past projects, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">multiply by the total floor area</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">apply updated unit rates</mark>, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">make percentage adjustments</mark> for other special factors like site location, building type and complexity, plan shape, storey and building height, etc.
- Bonus: enhance the accuracy on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantity by using the architectural layout plans</mark> with assumption on sizes of key structural members learned from past projects. Measure their approximate quantities and combine with the other members
- Use the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">framing plan</mark> provided by the structural engineers, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">measure approximate quantities</mark> per floor area (of sampled area), <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">multiply by the total floor area</mark>, apply <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">steel ratios</mark> provided by the structural engineers, and apply updated <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unit rates</mark>

## Estimate for Land Bid

- Land cost = revenue - costs other than land cost - profit
- Revenue (Gross Development Value)
	- Sales value
	- Discounted to give the present value
- Cost other than land cost & profit
	- Construction cost
	- Professional fee: <= 15% of construction cost
	- Fees and charges upon sales: <= 10% of gross development value
	- Finance charge on expenditure incurred before sales
		- Interest % per annum
		- Construction cost and professional fee
			- Assume not on sales coz short financing period
		- Financing period (simplified) = (design period + contract period + DLP) x 50%
	- Developer's administration costs and profit: 10% - 15% of gross development value
	- Compensation to adjoining residents and similar soft costs
		- If any, very small % of gross development value
- Further deduction for fees and charges upon land acquisition for valuer, lawyers, etc.
	- % of land bid price
