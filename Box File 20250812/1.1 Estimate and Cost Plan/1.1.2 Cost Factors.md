### Significant increase in TPI *(2008 Q1.2)*

- The escalation in general <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inflation</mark> as evidenced by Consumer Price Index in Hong Kong and Mainland China has affected prices and wages at large.
- Steady growth in the local property <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">market</mark> and the Hong Kong government's policy of increased expenditure on infrastructure works suggest that contractors are more selective in tendering due to increased workload and they tend to allow for a wider bid margin in their prices.
- As a result of the increased workload both in Hong Kong and Macau, it has caused an increase in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">demand for labour</mark> resources; and therefore rises in labour and staff <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">salaries</mark> and wages generally.
- The construction boom in Mainland China, Macau and the Middle East also has impacted the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prices of construction materials and heavy plant</mark> and machineries generally.
- The steel bar-benders' month-long <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">strike</mark> in Aug 07 had impact not only on steel bar-benders' wages but also on other construction workers' wages
- Most of the building materials are from Mainland China, Europe and other foreign countries. Because of the appreciation in RMB, Euro Dollars and other foreign <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">currencies</mark>, as compared with the weaker HK and US Dollars, imported building materials tends to cost more
- There have also been significant increases in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">major new material prices</mark> internationally, e.g. increase in iron ore prices has caused sharp increase in re-bar and steel prices
- More <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stringent control</mark> through taxes and duties by means of cancelling some of the tax rebates for export materials, and also imposing additional taxes on some of the export materials, e.g. cement and rebar, by the Chinese Authorities.
- The Chinese Authorities have also imposed restrictions on, and therefore reduced the export of, some selected materials such as river sand.
- The increase in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">oil prices</mark> in latter part of 2007 to early 2008 resulted in increase in prices of oil by-products (e.g. vinyl and PVC products) together with increased transportation costs.

### TPI purpose and limitation *(2017 D1Q3a)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Purpose and limitation</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">TPI</mark> are often compiled by government departments and QS consultants based on data collected from tenders. The targeted sector varies from index series to index series. Indices <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complied by government departments often focus on public works while indices complied by QS consultants often focus on private sector</mark>. Most of the TPIs published by QS consultants measure tender price movements of a fixed quantified list of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">notional builder's works items which are typical</mark> to building construction projects, and may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exclude certain building elements</mark>, e.g. piling, substructures, external works and mechanical & electrical services
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Factors reflected by TPI</mark>
		- General <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fluctuations</mark> of common materials, labour and plant costs
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Trend of risks allocation</mark> between contractors and employers
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Competition</mark> among contractors
	- However, since the quantified list is fixed, TPIs generally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">do not reflect changes in design standards</mark> and provisions of the building occurring after the Base Year of the respective index in response to the property market.
	- Even if TPI has been compiled very responsive to changes in the design standards and provisions, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a single TPI covering all building types</mark> would only represent the weighted average of all building types. Because of the different choices of design standards and provisions, the unit construction costs of different building types are different, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changes of the unit construction costs of different building types over time are different</mark>. Some unit construction costs will change more rapidly than the averaged TPI while other unit construction costs will fall behind.
	- TPI is just an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aid to indicate the general average trend of tender price level changes of all building types</mark>. It would be useful to serve as an economic <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">indicator and for making minor adjustment</mark> due to change in time to costs already estimated on a more solid basis for estimating purposes. TPIs are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on historical tender prices</mark> which trend may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not necessarily apply to the future</mark>.
	- Even the unit construction cost for a particular building type is also an average of that particular building type, and should not directly be applied to a particular building
	- The actual cost of a building will depend upon the design, site conditions and many other factors relevant to that particular building. The more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">solid cost estimate should be based on the building itself rather than</mark> relying on the published TPI or unit construction cost for that building type.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reason for residential unit construction cost rising more rapidly than the TPI </mark>
	- Increasing tendency of developers <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uplifting the design standards</mark> and provisions of private residential buildings in the past decade:
		- Increased floor-to-floor height
		- Adoption of curtain wall system and glazed screen
		- Heavy use of natural stone finishes
		- Luxurious provision of kitchen appliances
		- Luxurious provision of sanitary fittings and wares
		- Sophisticated clubhouse design, etc.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BEAM Plus</mark> certification
	- Mandatory implementation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Building Energy Codes</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Enhanced fire services provisions</mark> required by latest Code of Practice / Circular Letters
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Enhanced site safety, environmental management and site hygiene</mark> provisions
