## General of Life Cycle Costing

- Definition: appraisal of the cost of a building throughout the lift cycle
- Purpose
    - Optimize the value of the asset
    - Cash flow prediction
    - Option appraisal
- Advantages
    - Cost benefit analysis
    - Total cost consideration instead of initial cost only
    - Forecast future cash flow
    - Better maintenance strategy
    - Reduce future maintenance cost in construction stage
    - Consider total cost of life cycle instead of initial cost only
- LCC in different stages
    - Inception stage - investment appraisal
    - Planning and Design- evaluate design options in life cycle cost
    - Construction stage - compare tender based on LCC instead of initial cost
    - Maintenance stage - decide when to refurbish or redevelop
- Reason for not widely used
	- Client ignorance, lack of awareness
	- Accuracy relies on a number of assumptions
	- Lack of appropriate historical cost data
	- Professional accountability - accuracy not apparent for years
	- Technological changes not considered
	- Poor workmanship may accelerate deterioration
- Application
	- Establish the objective
	- Choice of alternatives
	- Formulate assumptions
	- Identify the life of the project and individual components
	- Investigate capital cost constraints
	- Calculate the cost of alternatives
	- Compare costs and rank alternatives (discounted values)
	- Sensitivity analysis
 
## Principle

- Terminology
    - Net Present Value (NPV)
	    - Sum of discounted present values of all future cash inflows & outflows
    - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
	    - Discount rate that will lead to a NPV of zero
	    - Reflect the relative productiveness of the capital
    - Discount Rate (r)
        - Nominal Discount Rate: the rate of interest reflecting the investor’s time value of money
        - Real Discount Rate = Nominal Discount Rate - Inflation Rate
    - Present Value (PV)
        - Present Value: the present day worth of a future cost discounted at a given interest rate
        - Net Present Value: the present day value of future costs net of future incomes
        - Compound: PV → FV
        - Discount: FV → PV
    - Annuity (A)
        - Periodic payment
        - Ordinary Annuity: payment at the end of a period
        - Annuity Due: payment at the beginning of a period
    - Number of period (n)
        - usually 20-40 years
- Life Cycle Cost
	- LCC = cost - residual value
    - Initial Investment Cost
        - Land acquisition
        - Professional fee
        - Financial charge
        - Construction cost
    - Operation Cost
        - Energy, water and other utilities cost
        - Security, cleaning, technicians
        - Lease
        - Insurance
    - Maintenance and Repair Cost
        - Facility management and maintenance
        - Redecoration
    - Overhaul 翻修 / Replacement Cost
    - End-of-lift Cost 
	    - Removal
	    - Residual value
- Procedures
	- Determine the time frame
		- Expected lifespan of the building or a predefined period
	- Discounted rate
		- Inflation, prime rate, opportunity cost
	- Calculate LCC by discounted cash flow
		- Bring costs incurred at different times to same time for comparison
	- Sensitivity analysis
		- See how changes of key variables affect LCC

### LCC for air-conditioning system *(2012 D1Q4)*

- LCC of air-conditioning system can be expressed as following:-
	- ![image.png|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20250804212514.png)
- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">capital costs</mark> can include:
	- The supply and installation costs of the systems
	-  the costs of different times to supply and install the system
	- The costs of areas and spaces to accommodate the system
	- The costs of the plant rooms and pipe ducts
	- The costs of builder's works and concealing or decorative fitting out works affected
	- The extra design fee in reviewing and including the system into the original building design scheme
	- Capital cost may be reduced because of subsidies or bonuses offered by utility companies or government
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Long term cost</mark> included
	- Daily operation cost - labour / technicians manning the system, consumables like power, fuel, water, lubricants, etc., insurances and overhead charges
	- Regular maintenance and repair cost - regular costs incurred at a longer interval
	- Overhaul 翻修 and replacement cost - scheduled overhaul work on and replacement of major component at its end of life, e.g. once in every 5-8 years, and for the sake of comparison of two systems with different life spans, terminal replacement cost at the end of life of the system
	- Disposal costs - demolishing and disposing the whole system at the end of the system
	- Residual value - the possible scrape or re-sale value of the system upon disposal
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Discounted cash flow calculation</mark> is to be used to bring costs incurred at different time to the same time for comparison
- The life span of the system is also very important. When two systems have different life spans, the calculation should be based on the same lowest common multiple of years of life spans. However, the possibility of the system becoming obsolete 废弃的 by its end of life and the possibility of a major modification because of a change of the building functional layout <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">before the system's normal life span</mark> should also be considered.


## Formula

- Future Value

- Present Value

    - Annuity Due

    - If Internal Rate of Return = Discount Rate, NPV = 0

## Land Bidding Price

- Land cost = revenue - costs other than land cost - profit
- Revenue (Gross Development Value) = sale price x CFA
- Costs other than land cost
    - Professional fee
        - <15% of construction cost _(2000 Q2.1)_
    - Fees and charges upon sales like ad, marketing, agencies, legal costs
        - <10% of gross development value _(2000 Q2.1)_
    - Finance charges on expenditure incurred before sales
        - Interest rate % per annum
        - Construction cost + professional fee
        - Effective period of financing
            - 6 months design period _(2000 Q2.1)_ + construction period + 1 year DLP
            - Overall period discounted x 50%
    - Developer's administration costs and profit
        - 10% - 15% of gross development value _(2000 Q2.1)_
    - Compensation to adjoining residents and similar soft costs
        - Very small % of gross development value
- Land bid price
    - Surplus of gross development value
        - Discounted to present value
    - Finance charge for land price
        - Paid now until surplus is realized
    - Fees and charges upon land acquisition for valuers, lawyers, etc.
        - % of land bid price
    - Profit
