## Basis of Estimate

- The estimate is based on prices current at xxxx obtained by competitive tendering for lump sum fixed price contracts with a normal contract period. No provision has been made for possible future fluctuations in tender price occurring between the time of preparing the estimate and time of calling tenders
- The preliminary estimate of construction cost is based on Architect's preliminary sketches received on xxxx and average square meter unit costs and should be regarded as a preliminary indication of costs subject to further detailed estimates as the design progresses.
- All allowances are based on Architect's / Engineer's preliminary advice and are subject to further change as the design development proceeds.
- Allowance for Furnishing, Furniture & Equipment should be further checked by the client.
- Allowance for foundation, substructure, structure and E&M installations are QS's approximation and assumption only and should be checked and advised further by the Consulting Engineers.
