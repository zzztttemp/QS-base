## Concept of Novation

- An existing contract between A & B is discharged and a fresh contract is made between A & C
- Assignor to pass onto another party (assignee) the right to call for performance of the obligations owed to it
- ![Exported image|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Exported%20image%2020241128145940-2.png)

- Characteristics
    - Consideration required, new contract
    - Where some or all the rights or obligations of the old party and novator are set aside, use a new tri-partite agreement
    - Novation agreement should not contain any further obligations not in the original agreement
    - New terms of conditions are usually the same
    - No-loss rule: the assignment cannot pass to the assignee any greater rights than the assignor had
- Compare with assignment & sub-letting
	- Novation: transfer right and obligation
	- Assignment: transfer right
	- Sub-letting: transfer obligation

### Novation & Reason to Refuse *(2021 D2Q1a)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Novation</mark>
	- A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">novation</mark> agreement has to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">signed</mark> by the original contract parties, the Client and the supplier, and by the building contractor, whereby all the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rights and obligations</mark> of the Client will be transferred to the building contractor with no further concerns. The supplier and the building contractor will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">continue</mark> to fulfill the terms of the supply contract as if they were the original contract parties except as modified by the novation agreement. The building contractor will have to take up the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks of the performance</mark> of the supplier.
	- If the supply contract terms and the pro-forma novation agreement are fully included in the tender documents for the building contract, the chances for the building contractor to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">refuse</mark> novation will be reduced. However, the building tenderer will have to consider whether he can accept the transferred obligations and risks, and state his non-acceptance when submitting his tender, e.g.:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inconsistencies between the terms</mark> included in the supply contract (i.e. not- back-to-back approach enough to cover his risks)
		- The supplier is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">technically or financially incapable</mark>  to deliver 
		- The supplier is already known to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late</mark>
		- The supplier and the tenderer have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">poor relationship</mark> before
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">After his own appointment</mark>, the building contractor may <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">refuse</mark> novation if the situations at the time of novation are different from those described in the tender documents or accepted tender, e.g.:
		- The supplier is already <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quality</mark> of the products of the supplier is found to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not consistent</mark> with the requirements of the building contract
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Client has not duly paid the supplier</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">updated supply contract sum is more</mark> than that upon which the building contract sum is based
	- The Client will have to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exempt the building contractor from such known and valid complaints</mark>, agree adjustment to the building contract sum or contract period, include terms to deal with similar future happenings, etc., all under the building contract, in order to get the building contractor to sign the novation agreement. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Otherwise</mark>, the novation will fail and the Client will have to continue with the supply contract with the supplier, deal with the supplier's problems directly, and deal with the adverse implications upon the building contract according to the building contract.
 
## Assignment of Benefit (different from novation)

- An original party transfer only contractual rights (benefit / burden of contract)
- Benefit & burden
	- E - the right to have the works completed
	- C - the right to receive payment
	- E - the duty to pay
	- C - the duty to complete the works
- General principle
	- Burden of a contract cannot be assigned without consent of the other party
- Limit of assignment
    - Legal assignment v equitable assignment
        - Absolute, in writing, sufficient notice
    - SFBC
        - Notification required (cl 19.1)
            - Employer can assign benefit after SC without consent (cl 19.1)
        - Contractor cannot assign whole works / management (cl 19.2)
        - Contractor can assign benefit for obtaining financing with prior notice (cl 19.1)
    - No-loss rule
        - Assignor cannot pass to the assignee any greater rights than the assignor had
        - No greater damages than assignor could have
        - e.g. flat purchase in collateral warranty with Contractor - sue directly
    - Case
        - St. Martins Property v Sir Robert McAlpine (1993)
            - MC breach after invalid assignment -> Employer cannot recover loss
        - Linden Gardens v Lenesta Sludge (1993)
            - MC breach before assignment -> Assignor recover damages on behalf of occupier
        - Dunlop v Lambert
            - A party to a contract who suffered no loss can sue and recover substantial damages on behalf of a third party
 
## Advice to MC to Avoid Claims from 3P

- Document all contractual relationships clearly
- Wording that MC does not assume any responsibilities to 3P directly or indirectly
- If collateral warranties with occupier, clear wording to exclude responsibilities to the beneficiary of the warranties directly or indirectly
