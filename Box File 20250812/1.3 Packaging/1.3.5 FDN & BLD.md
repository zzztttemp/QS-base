### Specification Preliminaries clause

- MC to accept <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">novation</mark> of FDN
	- The foundations steel sheet piling and grouting works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">are being carried out under a separate contract </mark>(the Foundation Contract).The Foundations Contract documents can be examined in the office of the Architect upon prior appointment. It is a requirement of this Contract that the Employer may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at his sole discretion novate</mark> the Foundation Contract to the Main Contractor. The Main Contractor, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">by submitting their tender acknowledges that he will have no right, if his tender is accepted to object to such novation nor to deny</mark> the responsibilities, undertaking and liabilities provided under the Foundation Contract. The Main Contractor shall upon request by the Employer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">promptly and duly execute and deliver the agreement</mark> and all such further instruments and documents as the Employer may reasonably require for the purpose of perfecting the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Novation Agreement</mark> (a sample Novation Agreement is attached as Appendix B to these Specification Preliminaries). Upon such novation, the works under the Foundation Contract shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">constitute part of the Works </mark>under this Main Contractor and the Foundation Contractor shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deemed to be domestic sub-contractor </mark>of the Main Contractor. The Main Contractor shall agree and co-ordinate with the Foundation Contractor for the completion of the foundation works in suitable stages to enable the earliest commencement of the ELS and subsequent works to facilitate the timely completion of the Works or any Section thereof). The Main Contractor shall closely monitor the progress of the foundation works in accordance with the agreed schedule such that no delay is caused to the ELS and subsequent works. The Main Contractor shall submit with his tender the time and cost implication on his tender to cater for such novation requirement.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">MC to allow FDN to rectify defects</mark>
	- The Main Contractor is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">verify the setting out of the foundation and sheet piling before commencement</mark> of his work, and shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">report immediately in writing to the Architect on any errors</mark> found in that setting out. The Main Contractor shall also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">report immediately to the Architect on any defects</mark> found in the foundation construction. In the event of the Main Contractor<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> failing to observe</mark> this requirement any of the works under this contract incorrectly constructed as a result of such errors in the foundation works shall if so required by the Architect be pulled down and re-erected <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at the Main Contractor's expense.</mark>
	- The Main Contractor is to note that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defects liability period of the Foundation Contract runs concurrently</mark> with this Contract and the Main Contractor shall<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> permit the Foundation Contractor to access the site and if needed make available any necessary site facilities</mark> for the Foundation Contractor to make good the defects or to complete any outstanding works.

### BLG & FDN Simultaneously *(1992 Q2)*

- Background
	- Delay caused by foundation contractor (FC), alternative proposal to reduce the delay
	- Engineer comments that remaining foundation works and construction of diaphragm wall by the Building Contractor (BC) can be constructed simultaneously
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Proposal 1. FC & BC works simultaneously on the same site</mark>
	- Contractual implication
		- Contractually not feasible
		- FC have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exclusive possession</mark> of the entire site. No one can enter the site without his consent except those have authority to do so under the contract. BC is not permitted to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enter the site</mark> to execute his work.
		- It is impossible to have 2 contractors to possess the same site together
		- The contract in possession of the site shall bear the full <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibilities</mark> on the followings:-
			- Injuries and death of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">3rd parties</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Damages</mark> to properties
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Noise</mark> control
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Temporary lighting, power and water supply</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Protection</mark> of public
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Temporary works / access / hoarding</mark>
			- Protection to adjoining buildings
		- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to allocate the control / responsibilities</mark> between 2 contractors if the site is possessed by them together
		- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to have 2 contractors to cooperate and coordinate</mark> with each other
	- Time and cost implication
		- High chance that the 2 contractors may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disrupt</mark> the other's progress which may lead to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dispute</mark> on delay
		- The 2 contractors may join together to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">claim the Employer for disruption cost and EOT</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Proposal 2. Omit the remaining works from FC and give it to BC</mark>
	- Contractual implication
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">VO</mark> to omit the works
		- FC might claim <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss of profit</mark> on the omitted works
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Agreement</mark> from FC must be sought
		- FC may use some terms of negotiation e.g. to waive LD for delay
	- Time implication
		- Negotiation may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">take time</mark> and lead to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">dispute</mark>
		- It may take time for FC to remove all his plants and equipment for the caisson works and for BC to bring his plants and equipment for the remaining work
	- Cost implication
		- FC might claim loss of profit on the omitted works
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost</mark> of the remaining caisson by BC should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher</mark> than that of FC due to:-
			- Set up of plant for such small scale of works
			- Less economically use of plants and other resources
			- Price based on prevailing market conditions (if the price inflate)
		- FC may ask to relieve his liability to LD in return of his agreement
	- Design and defect liability
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design liability</mark> becomes ambiguous and confused
			- FC design the foundation and BC construct part of it
		- Difficult to define the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defects liability</mark> which may be caused by design fault or poor workmanship in construction
		- In case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">latent defects</mark> like excessive settlement / differential settlement, it is difficult to identify the cause and responsibility
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Proposal 3 (recommended). Take possession of the complete caissons, handover the remaining part of the site to BC</mark>
	- Procedure & Caution
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Partial possession</mark> by Employer (cl.18); <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Consent</mark> from FC is required
		- Employer to take possession of the completed caissons and defined at Stage 1 portion of the site; Employer to handover Stage 1 portion of the site to BC, remaining uncompleted caissons are Stage 2 portion of the site
		- FC will continue continue to execute the remaining works, and still liable for delay; <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LD of FC is reduced</mark>
		- BC must be notified that the site will be handed over for possession in 2 stages with different date for possession; <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BC could have time and cost effect</mark>
		- FC & BC will work simultaneously in the 2 portions of the same site, and BC shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordinate</mark> with FC for timely execution of the works
		- All requirements should be covered in the "Preliminaries" Bill section of BC
		- Architect must <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">define the extent of portion 1 & 2</mark>
	- Time
		- BC & FC can concurrently work on the same site in portion 1 & 2 respectively
		- Time lost due to the delay in caisson works are gained back by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">early possession and commencement</mark> of BC
	- Cost
		- FC is required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relocate</mark> his plants, site office, erecting additional fencing to separate portion 1 & 2 before BC entering the site
		- Require AI to execute temporary works
		- BC make some additional allowance in Preliminaries for necessary <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordination with FC such as temporary electricity and water</mark>
	- Contractual
		- The whole foundation works area executed by one contractor (FC), hence there will be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clear liability and responsibilities regarding patent and latent defects</mark> of the foundation works
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design liability and indemnity</mark> to the Employer is clear
		- Attention of BC is addressed, therefore no problem in handle of the building contract of BC
		- The objection from FC will not be expected because this arrangement will benefit FC by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reducing their burden of LD</mark> for non-completion
		- Following shall be affected when execution: -
			- Architect's Certificate shall be issued and stated that the estimate of the approximate total value of the part of foundation works handover to the Employer
			- Partial completion of the relevant part shall be deemed to have completed and defects liability period of the relevant part shall commence on the date of possession by the Employer
			- The LD rate shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis and the retention money shall be released on a pro-rata basis
			- FC shall submit a revised programme showing partial handover and outstanding works to be completed at Stage 2
			- To avoid interference, different site access shall be situated for the 2 contractors

### FDN defect to be rectified during MC *(2009 D2Q1)*

- The MC shall allow any person who is directly engaged by Employer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable access</mark> to the site and permit him to carry out his work.
	- Cl.30.2(1) where the Contract identifies and gives a general description of subject rectification work
	- Cl.30.2(2) where the Contract does not identify or mention the subject rectification work, on the condition that if MC incurs additional costs by doing so, MC will be entitled to reimbursement of these costs
- In the event of any delay caused to MC and affected works are critical to the completion of MC, the MC will be entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark>.
	- By reason of delay caused by a specialist contract as the listed event in cl.25.1(3)(p)
	- By reason of Employer subsequently depriving the Contractor of a part of the Site as listed event in cl.25.1(3)(s)
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Provided that MC</mark> provides substantiation required by the Contract
- In the event of the progress of MC has been or is likely to be delayed or disrupted by the rectification works, MC will be entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">direct loss and expense</mark>
	- By reason of AI under cl.13.1 requiring a variation (imposing a restriction on the Contractor regarding use of any part of site or limitation of working space constitutes a variation)
	- By reason of delay or disruption caused by a specialist contract as the qualifying event in cl.27.1(2)(i)
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Provided that MC</mark> provides substantiation required by the Contract and fulfills the notice requirements
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Insurance</mark>
	- MC needs to notify its insurers for CAR and TPI of the likelihood of the previous FDN returning to the site to rectify the foundation defects, as both of these insurances would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have covered such work or the involved party</mark>. Therefore an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">endorsement</mark> needs to be added to the insurance policies to cover such party and works involved. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">premium</mark> may need to be increased to include the coverage. Such premium cost, if any, will be recoverable under the appropriate clause of the Contract.

### FDN propose do BLD as well *(2017 D1Q4a)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Benefits of one contract</mark>
	- Elimination of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">demobilization time</mark> by FDN and mobilization time by BLD after completion of the foundation works
	- Reduction of overall time due to more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time overlap</mark> of the foundation works and superstructure works
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Saving of some temporary protection</mark> measures otherwise required due to two contracts
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less interfacing problems</mark> when incorrect foundation works occurs and requires <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rectification</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Undivided responsibility</mark> by one contractor
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Possibility of deferring the design</mark> of part of the superstructure work otherwise required for tendering for the Superstructure Contractor
	- Possibility of using the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's design and buildability input for the development of the superstructure design</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Elimination of the time required to prepare full-blown Tender Documents and conduct tendering</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Drawbacks of one contract</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design</mark> of superstructure works not yet completed for tendering
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender Documents</mark> for the superstructure works not yet prepared
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Competitive tender prices</mark> for the superstructure works not yet obtained
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Deferment of the foundation works</mark> even if tendering for the superstructure now is possible 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less price certainty and more arguments</mark> if the prices for the superstructure works are negotiated with the lowest foundation works tenderer based on schedule of rates or provisional quantities or cost-plus
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No benchmark to judge</mark> whether the prices for the superstructure works would be cheaper
	- Increase of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time required to calculate</mark> and agree the prices <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">during the post contract stage </mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Issues to be resolved</mark>
	- Credibility, track record, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">technical and financial capabilities</mark>, statutory qualifications, etc <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">of the lowest tenderer to be checked</mark> to ensure that he is capable and trustworthy and not just deceiving to secure more works
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Drafting of specification and contract provisions</mark> to cover the superstructure works and to cover the later availability of the complete design
	- Possible inclusion of responsibility to provide <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's design input</mark>
	- Agreeing a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pricing mechanism</mark> for the superstructure works, i.e. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">schedule of rates or  provisional quantities</mark> or cost and fee definitions and fee basis 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Finding a pricing benchmark</mark> such as past jobs with the same character
	- Setting a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deadline to drop the idea and award FDN</mark>

### FDN Remeasurement Basis *(2022 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">H-size drilling in lieu of N-size drilling</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Without prior approval</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification</mark> clearly states to use N-size drill "unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or instructed by the Engineer"
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Without Engineer's instruction</mark>, Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shall not change</mark> the drilling from N-size to H-size for drilling through rock at his own discretion. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Whether the sample is acceptable or not is irrelevant</mark> to the principle of remeasurement for the final account. There shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be additional cost payable for non-conforming</mark> work accepted without rectification. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the cost is less, the acceptance without rectification may require price reduction</mark>.
		- SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">17.3(5)</mark> expressly provides for price reduction. Price reduction can be put forward as a condition of accepting non-conforming work.
		- The draft final account shall be revised to measure those H-size quantities as N-size which should have been done as N-size especially when the rate for N-size is lower
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">With prior approval</mark>
		- If the Contractor had sought the Engineer's approval prior to any field works, the work was authorised beforehand. If there was no clear agreement at the time of approving the Contractor's proposal, there can be argument over whether this should be treated as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">acceptance of the Contractor's proposal without cost effect</mark> or as an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer's instruction with cost effect</mark>.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that he was only <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seeking a clarification instruction</mark> from the Engineer without any intent of putting forward a Contractor's proposal
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification</mark> clauses are qualified by the words "normally" and "unless otherwise instructed by Engineer". This implies that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">choice between H-size and N-size can be decided by Engineer</mark>. This would be particularly so when the Contract is a remeasurement contract.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Engineer may argue</mark> that it was Contractor who proposed first, he was only <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approving the Contractor's proposal without any intent to give higher price</mark> particularly when H-size is more expensive. 
		- It may be possible that when the Engineer approved, he was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not aware of the higher rate for H-size</mark>. He raised argument now only because N-size has been priced cheaper than H-size. Had H-size been priced cheaper, no argument would be raised. It is not reasonable to choose the more favourable option after the event. Had the Engineer been aware of the higher rate, he should have dealt with the matter at the time of the approval.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A reasonable conclusion should be based on true intent with proof.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Measuring "extra over"</mark>
		- BQ item 1.07 is for drilling through soil in N-size, while item 1.09 is for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra cost of that portion</mark> in rock out of the total length in item 1.07. These are clearly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">two different items and priced</mark>. Without the extra over item, the rate for item 1.07 should be the average of drilling though various materials. With the presence of the extra over item, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the rate for item 1.07 shall no be deemed to include the extra cost in rock</mark>. Whether the two items should have the same <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remeasured quantities should be double-checked</mark>. If the drilling started from exposed rock surfaces, both quantities can be the same, otherwise, the draft final account should be revised.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Point of termination of drillholes</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual quantities</mark> required for ground investigation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">depend greatly on the ground conditions encountered</mark>. That is why a remeasurement contract is used.
		- What the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification sets out are guidelines</mark> which do not necessarily work out an absolute point of termination. The point of termination depends on the ground condition with practical judgement by the Contractor and the Engineer as well. As the question says, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer is satisfied that the point of termination is within the acceptable range of tolerance</mark>. It shall be regarded as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valid information for remeasurement</mark>.

### GI works by FDN (2024 D1Q2a)

- This suggestion is not a good one because it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unlikely to advance the time to complete the foundation works but is likely to cause significant post contract</mark> additional time, costs, claims and arguments
- Foundation Contractor can only tender based on the foundation design provided to him. If the foundation design is not complete, and the final design is different from the tendered foundation design, the time to complete will be increased or decreased depending on whether the design becomes more difficult or easier, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruptive effects</mark> will most likely happen. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contract Sum will need to be adjusted</mark> for the changed quantities. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates may become not applicable</mark> if the types, sizes, lengths and depths of piles are changed. Contractor will likely take the opportunity to argue for better unit rates for the changes.
	- To reduce the arguments over the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unit rates</mark> to be adopted for changes, the foundation tenderers may be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quote unit rates for possible alternative</mark> types, sizes lengths, and depth of piles, as anticipated by SE.
	- To reduce the arguments over the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">time</mark> for completion, the foundation tenderers may be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">propose the completion times for different schemes of foundation systems</mark> of different types, number and dimensions, also as anticipated by SE.
	- To reduce the arguments over <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">prolongation</mark> costs to be paid when the actual completion times are longer than the proposed completion times due to issues for which the Contractor is entitled to additional payments, the foundation tenderers may be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quote for the daily charge of idling plant, idling staff and labour, prolonged use of site facilities</mark>, etc.
- The above measures may help reduce the arguments but the varieties and combinations may be too many for the tenderers to quote competitively, and the assumptions may not be correct. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time and cost certainties</mark> are low before the foundation design is finalized.
- Items for the GI works will also need to be included for tendering if the works are given to the Foundation Contractor to carry out.
	- A better way to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">resolve</mark> is to follow the normal practice of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">having the GI works fully carried out and the foundation design fully completed</mark> after that before calling for foundation tenders. Because the critical time to complete will in any case depend on the completion of the last pile for submission to BD for inspection. Such normal practice should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not take longer time than deferring</mark> the GI works to the Foundation Contractor, because the time required to prepare tender documents, call for tenders and appoint the GI is relatively short. Negotiation with a trustworthy GI contractor can speed up the process, while any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost premium should be minor</mark> when compared with the foundation costs.
	- Since the site can accommodate 5 residential buildings, it may be investigated whether the foundation plan submissions can be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">split</mark> into more than one parcel so that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">each parcel can have its own completion date for the BD to inspect</mark>, so as to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduce the impact of any localized delay to the whole site</mark>. Such arrangement will need to be written into the tender documents and delineated on the site plans.

### FDN & BLD separate or one single contract (2024 D1Q2cd)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">FDN and BLD awarded as two separate lump sum without quantities contract</mark>
	- As a common principle, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complete set of detailed drawings and specifications</mark> and sufficient tendering period should be given for the tenderers to measure the quantities and price the works with certainty and to reduce post contract changes and cost and time increases
	- If the tenders for the foundation works are to be issued in two weeks' time as scheduled based on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">incomplete foundation design</mark>, the complications as described under A above will apply.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If MiC is adopted</mark>, the complications as described under B above will apply, more severely to the foundation works but less severely to the building works which will be tendered for later, presumably the foundation period should be sufficiently long to cover the tender documentation, tendering, tender analysis, and contract award for the building works
	- Awarding the building works separately and later can have the advantage of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">giving more time for the design of the building works</mark> while the foundation works are in progress
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">D&B as one single contract</mark>
	- With this arrangement, the need to provide a complete set of detailed drawings and specifications as described above for tendering will be reduced, since the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design time will be moved to post contract stage</mark> which can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overlap with the construction works</mark>.
	- This arrangement will ensure <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">single point of responsibility</mark> upon the Contractor
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design brief / employer's requirements</mark> are required to be provided for tendering. If they are too detailed, the freedom of Contractor to design to his best will be reduced. If they are too loose, the Contractor's design may not meet the Employer's expectation.
	- Unless the contract is awarded on a cost reimbursable basis, the need to fix the design brief / employer's requirements when tendering is very important for lump sum contracts. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">freedom of the Employer to change his design brief</mark> / employer's requirements after contract award will be less as compared to design-bid-build arrangement. This should be the Employer's major consideration when adopting design-and-build.
	- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lump sum contract</mark>, it is very important to have sufficient <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ground investigation report</mark>, otherwise, the complications described under A will apply. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">recommendations to ask for pricing for different piling types and schemes given there would not be applicable</mark>.
	- As <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MiC is essentially designed and built by Contractor</mark>, making the whole contract a design-and-build contract appears to be compatible. However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor may not be experienced in the piling works</mark> nor have the qualification to carry out piling works by himself. He will have to sub-let to specialist piling contractors.
	- Bonus: it is usually said that design-and-build costs less than design-bid-build and needs less time, but the reality would depend on whether the contract requirements are clear and complete enough, and whether both the Employer and Contractor can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">work together co-operatively</mark> instead of maximizing self gain within the fixed lump sum by interpreting and exploiting the contract requirements to their best.
