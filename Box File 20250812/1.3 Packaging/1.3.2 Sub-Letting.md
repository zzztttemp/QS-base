### Direct Contract

- Possible issue / claim from MC
	- Attendance
	- EOT, L&E
	- Split of liability for defects

### Nominated Sub-Contract

- Award NSC before MC
	- Employer to award NSC on behalf of future MC
	- Novation arrangement of NSC back to MC
- Need earlier determination of main contract terms and details

### Concern of DSC for complex works *(2004 Q3B)*

- It will be very <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">convenient</mark> if MC can manage subcon to complete the project so that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility</mark> for completing the whole project will be under one umbrella, i.e. MC. However, there are risks associated with such an arrangement as follows:
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Management capability</mark> of MC with respect to subcon management
	- Whether or not MC has the knowledge and ability to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">select the most appropriate subcon</mark>
	- Whether MC can have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">access to the appropriate subcon</mark>
	- MC's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">selection criteria will predominantly be cost rather than quality</mark>
	- MC will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not consider better options</mark> for E even if such options are available
	- The programme for awarding a subcontract is in the hands of MC. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mismanagement of this programme</mark> will have undesirable consequences on the progress of the whole main contract.
	- Subcon's organizations are normally smaller and less knowledgeable than MC's organizations. MC could possibly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mistreat subcon to the MC's advantage</mark>. The main contract will therefore possibly suffer from quality and progress problems
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">E has no control</mark> on the timing and amount of payment for subcon. Mismanagement by MC may adversely affect the performance of even the most competent subcon
	- Many specialist subcon require a long lead time for the manufacture of custom products. E is relieved from the financial <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">burden of paying the deposits</mark> that are often required from these specialist subcon. However, such responsibility for payment is transferred to MC and as a result will increase the cost of the tender. In the vent that MC has not allowed for such payments to the specialist subcon, the choice of subcon would be limited
	- In the event of default by a subcon, E is not required to take responsibility for the consequences to the main contract of such default. However, that may not be in the best interest of E who would want to see MC in trouble and the time for completion exposed to potential delay
	- There is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no control on MC's mark up</mark> on a particular sub-contract, nor their charge for attendance

### Engage Maintenance Contractor at post-contract *(2008 Q2.2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Domestic Sub-Contract</mark>
	- The Architect could instruct the Contractor to employ the FS Maintenance Contractor to carry out the additional works as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark> by means of an AI under Conditions of Contract.
	- In this arrangement, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC could object to this arrangement</mark> as the subject variation works are outside the scope of Works that the MC originally contracted for and he could argue that this additional works are beyond this contemplation at the time of tender and therefore has no obligation to take up this work.
	- Alternatively, if MC agrees to undertake this additional work, MC shall also assume to have undertaken the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility</mark> for both quality and the timely completion of the additional works, albeit that the works are to be carried out by the FS Maintenance Contractor. It would be prudent for the MC to obtain prior agreement with Employer, Architect and FS Maintenance Contractor with regards to the time and cost implications related to this variation work.
	- As the completion of the fire sprinkler services would be required for FSD inspection, it is not unreasonable to deduce that the works fall on the critical path. MC may be entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark> due to this variation work. However, once MC commits to undertake this work, any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay in completion by the FS Maintenance Contractor shall be the responsibility of MC</mark>, unless otherwise due to other reasons given in the Contract that justify an EOT.
	- The valuation of the additional work shall include the cost of the works charged by FS Maintenance Contractor plus a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">% mark-up by MC</mark> for providing general attendance, risk and profit; and the cost for all necessary builder's work in connection with the additional work. When compared with the NSC arrangement, the % mark-up under the DSC arrangement would generally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">be expected to higher</mark> since MC takes up more risk and responsibility.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">NSC</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Subject to a mutual agreement</mark> between the Employer and MC, the additional work could be procured under NSC. FS Maintenance Contractor would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nominated by the Architect</mark> to MC under a set of sub-contract conditions, which could be agreed upon by MC.
	- Under the NSC arrangement, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks and responsibilities that to be borne by MC shall be less</mark> than that of DSC arrangement. Examples including the following:-
		- The conditions of NSC provide a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">back-to-back coverage</mark> to the MC for taking up the employment of the FS Maintenance Contractor. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In the case of delay</mark> caused by FS Maintenance Contractor, now being the NSC, the NSC shall be responsible for the same amount of LAD imposed by Employer to MC; thus relieving the responsibility from the MC.
		- It may also be considered necessary for the FS Maintenance Contractor to take up the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design responsibility</mark> related to the sprinkler modification works by providing a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Form of Warranty</mark> directly to the Employer. From MC's view point, and unlike under the DSC arrangement for which MC is totally responsible contractually, this arrangement shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relieve the MC from being directly responsible for the design of the works undertaken by NSC</mark>.
		- FS Maintenance Contractor may prefer this arrangement as he could seek <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">direct payment</mark> from the Employer in the event the MC fails to make any payment to him.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Direct contract</mark>
	- Under this arrangement, Employer will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">directly employ</mark> FS Maintenance Contractor, and the FS Maintenance Contractor shall carry out the works during the currency of MC.
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer and Architect shall be responsible</mark> for FS Maintenance Contractor. The responsibilities generally include:-
		- The on-site coordination between the FS installation and other adjacent trades.
		- The timely completion of the FS installation in order not to affect other trades.
		- The timely completion of the FS installation in order to not to affect any statutory inspection and, therefore, completion of MC 
		- Any disputes over claims and counter-claims between FS Maintenance Contractor and MC and/or other sub-contractors will be handled to Employer and/or Architect.
	- If no express conditions are stipulated in the Conditions of Main Contract, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC may not allow the FS Maintenance Contractor to enter the site as this may affect his insurance coverage</mark>.
	- In case there is any delay to the Works, it may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult for the parties to identify the cause of delay</mark>, and either MC or FS Maintenance Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">use the other party as an excuse</mark> for their own delay.

### NSC v DSC for D&B MiC *(2021 D2Q1b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">NSC</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Pro</mark>
		- The Employer may enter into temporarily binding contractual relationship with a specialist subcon manufacturing MiC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">before Contractor is appointed</mark>. This subcon will subsequently become the NSC although in some instances the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC has the right to raise reasonable objections</mark>.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Early engage</mark> of the specialist subcon for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">early design input and manufacture</mark> before the appointment of the MC will be made possible
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC will not need to spend effort to invite tenders</mark>, select and then provide for a long lead period for the design and manufacture of MiC.
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">selection of an appropriate NSC</mark> with whom Architect / Employer has confidence will offer the ability for the Architect to obtain and integrate design and coordination information, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">greater control</mark> in respect of quality for an early commencement of the works.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Con</mark>
		- On the other hand, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect will take up the responsibility</mark> to set out the full details of NSC's works and coordinate and integrate with the design of the works not covered by the NSC.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC is deprived of his input</mark> at the design and manufacturing stage of the MiC modules. His input in logistics and buildability will be much reduced
		- MC may not be prefer NSC selected by Architect. That may cause more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordination issued</mark>.
		- MC is entitled to claim <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT and L&E</mark> in the vent of delay or default caused by specialist subcon nominated by Architect despite the MC's valid objection
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">DSC</mark>
	- As the specialist subcon is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">selected by MC</mark>, there would be no chance for objection to nomination. The specialist subcon may as well be MC's in-house department
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Early engagement</mark> of the specialist subcon for early design input and manufacture before the appointment of Contractor is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not possible</mark>
	- MC will have to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">invite tenders</mark>, select and then provide for a long lead period for the design and manufacture of MiC in his master programme
	- Submission and integration of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MiC design</mark> with the rest of the building works will have to be done <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">after</mark> the appointment of MC
	- Any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordination issues</mark> with the specialist subcon will have to be resolved and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">absorbed by MC</mark>, with no time or cost claim entertained for delay or default caused by specialist subcon
	- Involvement of MC in the design and manufacture stage should enhance the design and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">buildability</mark> 
	- There will be little <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">control by the Employer on the selection</mark> of the specialist subcon
	- The 18-month construction period may become <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tight with no early start</mark> of design and manufacture of MiC before MC is appointed
	- Tender <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price</mark> of MiC could be more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">competitive</mark> with MC's proposed subcon or in-house department
	- To get the benefits of early design and manufacture, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC himself should be appointed early as well</mark>
 
## MC's Liability under Employment Ordinance

- Statutory lability on principal contractor
- MC & main NSC - SC'S employees' 2 months o/s wages

## Procurement of Consultant (2021 D1Q3)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">A single lead consultant and its team</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Advantages</mark>
		- Tendering once only. Relatively <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">simple to procure</mark> as compared to many consultancy contracts
		- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">single point of responsibilities</mark> by and contact with the lead consultant
		- Relatively simple for the commissioning and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordination</mark> of services amongst various disciplines
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Consistency of design</mark> adopted for the re-branding
		- Likely to generate significant <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">market interest</mark> amongst major consultants due to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">high volume</mark> and predictability of business
		- Potential for efficiencies through <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">economies of scale</mark>
		- Bonus: retention of knowledge and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">learning</mark> within a single consultant leading to potential productivity increases
		- Bonus: ability to develop strategic <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relationships</mark> with the lead consultant
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Disadvantages</mark>
		- Reliant on a single consultant can increase <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks</mark> in event of any failure of this consultant or its sub-consultants
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less certainty of the quality</mark> of sub-consultants
		- No ongoing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">competition</mark> as only one lead consultant is appointed
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">response time</mark> when handling 20 nos shopping centres all at about the same time will be longer
		- Peak <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">workload</mark> may exceed the capacity of the lead consultant and its team
		- Bonus: risk of being <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stuck with</mark> the lead consultants with limited access to other consultants for their expertise, new technologies, alternative approaches and innovations
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Separately engaged consultants for different disciplines</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Advantages</mark>
		- Ability to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procure "the best in clause"</mark> consultant for each discipline. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quality is more certain</mark>.
		- Many <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">attract smaller specialist</mark> consultants to submit tenders
		- Separate consultants may generate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more new ideas</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Disadvantages</mark>
		- Tendering many times. More <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time consuming to procure</mark> as compared to a single lead consultant
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No single point of responsibilities</mark> by and contact with so many consultants
		- More complex to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">administer and coordinate</mark> the delivery of services due to larger number of the interfaces
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bigger consultants may not be interested</mark> if the total volume of business is reduced
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Many lead consultants and their teams standing by</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Comparison with advantages of Option 1</mark>
		- Similar advantage, still with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">one set of tender</mark> documents, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more effort to prepare the framework arrangement</mark>, standing offers and greater number of contracts
		- Similar advantage, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more than one lead consultant</mark>
		- Similar advantage in terms of commissioning and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">coordination</mark> amongst different disciplines, but more complex to administer and coordinate the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">greater number of contracts</mark>
		- More effort required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure consistency of design</mark>. More coordination by the Client would be required to pass on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accepted standards</mark> across different contracts 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Bigger consultants may not be interested</mark> because of the possible reduction in the total volume of business
		- Potential for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher fees due to loss of economies of scale</mark> when only one contract is awarded at a time
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Comparison with disadvantages of Option 1</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less reliant on single consultant</mark>. Greater chances to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">appoint the best team for each contract</mark> based on the contemporary conditions
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less certainty on quality of sub-consultants</mark>
		- Better chances of consultant team <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">performing better in expectation of being selected for the next</mark> contract within the framework.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quicker response</mark> time with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shared workload</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less likely to exceed the capacity</mark>
		- Bonus: access to a greater number of consultants for their <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expertise</mark>, new technologies, alternative approaches and innovation. Offering opportunities for ongoing benchmarking and competition between consultants for future projects.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Suggestions for improvement</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reduce the number of contracts</mark> to be awarded - on location or value basis 
		- Stipulate <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">discount</mark> to be applied <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if a greater number of contracts is awarded</mark> for services rendered for about the same time
		- Set out a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">realistic and deliverable programme</mark> of future workload to provide confidence and visibility to the tendering consultants
		- Make the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">criteria for awarding</mark> contracts under the framework simple and transparent
