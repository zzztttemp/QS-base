## Early procurement reasons *(2008 1.3)*

- Lift
	- Long lead time is required to the lift contractor to carry out the following activities:
		- To prepare and submit the lift <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design</mark> to the design team for approval, which includes calculations, shop drawings
		- To carry out <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design co-ordination</mark> with the design consultant with respect to the sizes of lift pit, lift shaft and lift machine room, etc.
		- To submit and obtain <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approval</mark> of lift equipment
		- To <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">manufacture</mark> the machinery

	- Lifts are required to be completed in advance of completion of the remaining works and be ready for statutory inspections.
