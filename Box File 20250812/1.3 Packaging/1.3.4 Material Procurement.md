### Material Supply by Employer *(2001 Q 2.3 & 2005 Q1B)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Validity</mark> of E's concept to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">save P&O</mark>
	- Profits and overheads are usually marked up as a percentage of the costs of construction inclusive of labour, materials and plant 
	- The profits and overheads recovered from a contract should be able to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cover its share of the actual overheads and expected profits of the company for the same period</mark>
	- If portion of the material costs is taken out, the percentage markup has to be increased in order to give the same amount of profits and overheads
	- There would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no saving</mark> in profits and overheads
	- There may be saving in profits and overheads due to other reasons, such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduced administrative costs of procurement, reduced risks in materials supply and quality</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Desirability</mark> of E's intended arrangement
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not</mark> desirable from the point of view of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reducing mark-ups for profits and overheads</mark>
	- Desirable if <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">E has better bulk purchasing or bargaining power</mark> than C
	- Less desirable because E and consultants would incur <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher administrative costs</mark>
	- Less desirable since E is taking up <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks of timely delivery and material quality</mark>
	- More desirable for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enumerated items</mark> which can be quantified precisely such as sanitary fittings, doors and ironmongery
	- Less desirable for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">items</mark> which involve less precise quantification, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">involve wastage calculations</mark> and are more easily affected by variations, such as tiles, cement, reinforcement
- Any better <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">alternatives</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Nominated supply contracts</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Standing offers</mark> by pre-selected suppliers for tenderers to choose as domestic supply
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">PC rate </mark>arrangement with standing offers by selected suppliers as domestic supply
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Issues to be addressed in supply contract & Main Contract</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Issues to be considered</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Timing</mark> and quantity of delivery from supplier to meeting installation programme
		- Clear demarcation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility for defective</mark> / damaged materials, and any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mechanism</mark> to establish same
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quantities</mark> to ordered, and how to ensure the ordered quantity are sufficient for the works and within bounds of reasonable <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wastage</mark> limits, and any need for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">spare parts</mark>
		- What if there is a need to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-order</mark> materials, due to change in design or due to contractor's excessive wastage? How to define time and cost liability?
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In the supply contract</mark>
		- Apart from the usual content of a supply contract, the following interfacing issues should also be addressed:
		- To confirm <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">timing of delivery</mark>
		- To confirm <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">supply rate to be valid for a stipulated period</mark>, to cater for re-ordering
		- To define the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procedure and timing for acceptance</mark> of the materials by independent surveyors / loss adjusters at the time of delivery or jointly with the MC during his taking delivery
		- To confirm <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">liability for damaged materials</mark> and mechanism for acceptance of materials
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery to site street level</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In the Main Contract</mark>
		- An <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">item for take delivery and fix</mark> should be measured, with appropriate preamble to highlight that the rate shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">include for taking delivery from E's store</mark>. If the actual location of the store can be confirmed, such information should be stated.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Alternatively</mark>, the responsibility for the timing and arrangement of taking delivery can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">placed upon MC</mark>, but such arrangements will require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prior firming up of the delivery terms</mark> with the supplier so that each tenderer will receive the same information from the supplier for fair tendering.
		- As E will be responsible to make available to MC the material at appropriate time, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">material delivery schedule</mark> should be firmed up before hand with the overseas supplier to avoid delaying MC's programme. Such tentative delivery schedule should be stipulated in the MC tender doc.
		- Installation will definitely involve wastage. To avoid contractual dispute due to MC's undesirable high wastage leading to material shortage and extra material supply cost, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preset wastage percentage</mark> should be stipulated in the contract, above which MC should be responsible for the time and cost required to overcome any deficit. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Alternatively, E's actual ordered quantity can be spelt out in the tender documents</mark> with a stipulation requiring <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC to be responsible for</mark> the time and cost implications for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">any extra tiles</mark> that may be required as a result of his excessive wastage.
		- The tender document should stipulate a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mechanism to monitor the quantity of tiles being taken over by MC</mark> from E's store, for control of material taken over and as the basis for calculation of wastage.
		- To eliminate possible future argument about liability for damages tiles discovered upon the supplier's delivery of the tiles to site, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC should be asked to inspect</mark> tiles before taking delivery and to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">assume full responsibility for broken</mark> tiles.
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">supply rate</mark> as confirm by the overseas supplier should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stipulated in the tender document</mark> so that if MC anticipates his wastage would exceed the present percentage, necessitating his placing an additional order with the overseas tile manufacturer, he <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can price for such risk.</mark>
		- Whilst the overseas supplier might have provided E with a guarantee for the tiles, there could be certain <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">manufacturer's instructions for fixing</mark> of such tiles associated with such guarantee, failing to comply with which will void the guarantee. Such manufacturer's instruction should be spelt out in the tender documents for MC's compliance.

### Provision in MC's tender for E's direct purchase *(2011 D1Q3b)*

- The direct purchase arrangement would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">involve Employer in entering into two separate contracts</mark>, one with supplier, one with MC.
- MC tender documents should deal with the following:
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Declaration</mark> - a statement that the special sanitary fittings would be supplied by a supplier employed directly by the Employer
	- Ancillaries - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">description</mark> as to whether and what ancillary items are included or excluded
	- Quantities - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">who would be responsible for calculating the quantities</mark> to be ordered
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Wastage and breakage</mark> - how much spares to cover wastages and breakage would be payable for by the Employer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Time</mark> - time to make the first and last order and time of delivery for the MC tenderers to judge whether this would be compatible with the overall programme
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery</mark> - delivery place, and MC's responsibility for taking delivery, off-loading, off-site storage, second handling, on-site hoisting, inspection, disposal of packings, etc.
	- Pricing - where the MC tenderers would have the opportunity to price for the above costs, as a separate item or as part of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">installation costs</mark>
	- Installation - where the special sanitary fittings would require any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special installation method</mark>
- Employer should be cautioned that MC would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be responsible for any deficiencies in the non-performance</mark> of the supplier

### Arrangement for E's direct purchase *(2016 D1Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Common issues</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Identification</mark> of Employer's direct purchase items
		- A comprehensive list of items
		- Scope of supply if ancillary materials are involved
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quantities, wastage, supplementary orders</mark>
		- All quantities or limited quantities
		- Method of calculating the quantities to be ordered at the Employer's expense considering joints, laps, wastage, breakage, spares, etc.
		- Responsibility for supplementary orders due to Employer's or Contractor's problems
		- Treatment of left-over
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery and storage</mark>
		- Stipulation of delivery schedule - early enough to suit site progress / late enough to suit ordering time / avoiding pre-mature demand by Contractor giving chance to claim for delayed delivery
		- Place of deliver - on-sire / off-site / street level / upper floors
		- Responsibility for unloading and return packing
		- Responsibility for coordination with supplier to confirm delivery schedule, batches and quantities
		- Responsibility for off-site storage charges in case of delivery earlier or later than the confirmed delivery schedule
		- Arrangement for joint inspection upon delivery
		- Arrangement for identifying and rejecting defective items upon opening packing
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Installation</mark>
		- Responsibility for assembling items delivered in knocked down components
		- Special drawings / specification / images / installation details / manufacturer's details or instructions, in addition to the usual labour and material specification
		- Special warranty requirements
		- Special supervision by the suppliers
		- Special test by the suppliers
- Specific <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">information to be confirmed with stone supplier</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Stone specification</mark>
		- Stone types - marble/granite/travertine/limestone, etc.
		- Stone name
		- Authentic photo of stones
		- Country of origin
		- Dimension - cut to size or slab, three dimensions
		- Characteristics - appearance, durability, strength
		- Responsibility for cutting to general or specific sizes
		- Responsibility for pattern matching
		- Responsibility for surface and edge treatment 
		- Ancillary materials
		- Responsibility for preparing fabrication drawings and site installation drawings
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quantities</mark>
		- Quantity of each type of stones
		- Total order, allowance for wastage
		- Minimum order
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Price</mark>
		- Breakdown with quantity and unit rate for each stone type ($/m2 or $/pc)
		- Additional charge for order less than minimum order
		- Additional charge for storage off-site due to Contractor's delay
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Terms of sale</mark> (in addition to those mentioned in common issues)
		- Delivery period of each batch and latest order date
		- Liability for late delivery
		- Payment terms, currency, letter of credits
		- Other rights and obligations of buyer and seller
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Others</mark> 
		- Sample / mockup for inspection during supplier selection stage
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Options for "fix only" and "supply and fix"</mark>
	- To enable the tenderers to quote for "fix only" and "supply and fix", there should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separate sections</mark> in the tender documents for the tenderers to price, probably treating "fix only" as the basic option and "supply and fix" as the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">alternative option</mark>.
	- To <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure that the tenderers will choose the selected</mark> supplier in case of "supply and fix", the simplest method is to:
		- Negotiate with the supplier to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obtain a quotation agreeable</mark> to Employer but not yet formally accepted
		- Include the supplier's quotation with all the details <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in the tender documents</mark> for the tenderers to negotiate and conclude the terms with the supplier
		- Include a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">declaration</mark> that apart from the material and performance specification, all other contractual or commercial terms contained in the quotation are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sole matters between the tenderers and the supplier</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Require the tenderers to state the name of the supplier chosen </mark>by him
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Compare the "fix only" and "supply and fix" rates to verify</mark> that the price difference is compatible with the supply prices known and with allowance for the Contractor's other costs and mark-ups
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If</mark> it is permitted that the tenderers <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can propose other</mark> suppliers supplying the same materials, it should be so stated.
	- If it is intended <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to secure the chosen supplier and his prices</mark> before including his quotation in the tender document, some kind of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">written understanding</mark> should be reached with the supplier to the effect that his offer is a fixed standing offer acceptable by the Employer or by the future Contractor.
	- Execution of a sales contract followed by a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">novation</mark> agreement involving the Employer, the supplier and the Contractor is possible but should be used as the last resort because of the complication.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If</mark> it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">necessary to secure</mark> the supplier earlier for example in order to secure the quarry, the price or earlier fabrication, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fix only option</mark> should be adopted.

### Negotiate payment terms with overseas vendor *(2005 Q4D)*

- 20% down payment - too large a payment with nothing actually realized upon payment made 
	- Advanced payment bond by manufacturer 
	- Reduce the % of down payment 
	- Upon signing a supply contract with judicial jurisdiction in Hong Kong
	- If the down payment is not negotiable, a surety bond could be imposed upon the supplier
- 75% payment by Letter of Credit (Letter of Credit serves as a payment guarantee from a creditworthy bank) - a large lump sum payment upon delivery affecting cash flow and too much risk
	- To be broken down into several LC's instead of one
	- To be broken down into more stages of payment instead of one
	- Revised to other forms of payment e.g. by tele-transfer
	- To relate a portion of the proposed % to other works such as completion of installation on site 
	- To decrease the 75% in this stage and increase the 5% in T&C stage
- 5% payment upon testing and commissioning
	- To negotiate to increase the % of last payment as an alternative form of security
- To negotiate a retention fund
- To negotiate a longer credit period of honouring payment

### Gap between MC & Supply Contract *(2013 D2Q3)*

- Ask you to identify, not ask you to JUST identify, appraisal & advise
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Title and delivery</mark>
	- MC often requires the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">title to materials delivered to site shall pass to the Employer upon delivery even without payment</mark>, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">forbid the Contractor to remove</mark> the materials from site without consent. The Supplier's terms <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">retain the title until the goods are paid in full</mark>. There will be a <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">conflict of title</mark> if the Contractor eventually does not pay the Supplier.
	- The Supplier's term regarding <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">retention of title is not unreasonable</mark>. However, if the materials are fixed, the Supplier can only claim against the Contractor for damages. If the materials are still unfixed, the Supplier may try to take back the materials, but his chance of success would be slim since the site is in Contractor's control.
	- The passing of the risk of loss or damage upon delivery is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">reasonable</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Payment term</mark>
	- Under MC, payment to Contractor for materials <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">will only be made after the materials are delivered to site</mark>, their value included in payment certificates which are not issued immediately but at <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">regular intervals</mark>, and the certificates honored for payment. This will take a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">long time after material delivery.</mark> Furthermore, the payment is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to retention</mark>. Since the Supplier requires <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">cash-on-delivery payment</mark>, the Contractor will have to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">pay the Supplier before he is paid</mark> by Employer much later.
	- The Contractor should <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">negotiate for grace period for payment</mark> and a lower rate of interest.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Delays</mark>
	- MC often puts the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk of delay in delivery of materials to site onto the Contracto</mark>r, even for force majeure cases and cases due to any cause beyond Contractor's control. Supplier's term <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">also puts the risks of delay to the Contractor</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Earlier ordering and delivery by batches</mark> would be some solutions to reduce the risks. Suppliers of good track record would also be important.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Warranty</mark>
	- Supplier's term regarding acceptance upon delivery would mean that the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Contractor will have to take up the risks if he fails to discover any quality problems upon delivery</mark>.
	- It is practically <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">impossible to open all packing</mark> for inspection upon delivery. It is usually agreed that the so-called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"acceptance" upon delivery</mark> is based on the number of unopened packages, or based on external visual inspection only of opened samples for obvious damage, shortage or errors, while quality problems which <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cannot be revealed by such inspection are still Supplier's responsiblity</mark>.
	- The Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">liability</mark> under MC for the quality of materials would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">last until the end of the DLP for patent defects</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">until the end of the statutory limitation period for latent defects</mark>, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">until the end of any special warranty period specifically required</mark>. The Supplier's warranty period of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">12 months after delivery is obviously too short</mark>.
	- For special materials, MC may require a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">warranty</mark> to be provided by Supplier directly or jointly with the Contractor to the Employer or future owners. The Supplier's term of providing <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">warranty to the Contractor only</mark> and to no other person would not be acceptable to the Employer. This would render the Supplier not acceptable.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Prices</mark>
	- The rates in MC are usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed and binding upon the Contractor for valuation of variations</mark> whereas the price given in the Quotation is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">only applicable for the qty stated</mark> therein. The Contractor has to <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">absorb the cost effect of any changes</mark> in the supply rates if the qty are varied, unless he has already <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">allowed</mark> for it.
	- The rates in MC are priced based on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">net area</mark> of the tiling <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">as fixed in place</mark>. The rates given in Quotation cover recommended joint allowances but <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">excludes allowance for cutting and wastage</mark>. When converting the supply rates to counter-check the budgetary <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">allowance</mark> in the supply and fix rates in MC, adjustments should be made or cutting the wastage.

### Add-on Item to Give full Supply Cost *(2022 D2Q2)*

- Allowance for cutting and installation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wastage</mark>
- Shipping <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery</mark> from the port to the fabrication yard
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Fabrication</mark> (usually cutting the stone slab to size and surface treatment)
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery</mark> from the fabrication yard to the site in Hong Kong
- Off-sit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">storage</mark> (if required)
- Import <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tax</mark> and VAT
