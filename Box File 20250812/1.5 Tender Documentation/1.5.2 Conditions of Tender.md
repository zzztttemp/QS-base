### Incomplete submission *(2003 Q 2.1)*

 - To tender assessment if information submitted is not complete
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not possible to assess</mark> the tender in the absence of a tender clarification process
	- Tender <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarification</mark> process may have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pitfalls</mark> as discussed later
	- Longer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time</mark> for the tender clarification process, if allowed
	- Longer time for the overall tender assessment process, thereby <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delaying</mark> the contract award
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible reasons</mark> for incomplete submission
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Costly</mark> to submit complete information as requested. Unless a tenderer is very confident that he has a very high chance of getting the contract, he may not be willing to spend money on preparing the submitting complete design information
	- Fear of competitive <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design ideas being borrowed</mark> and shared with other tenderers through the tender clarification process, thus losing the competitive edge
	- Financial status is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">business secrete</mark> which should not be disclosed
	- Fear of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exposure of unfavorable factual information</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not enough tendering period</mark> to prepare all the required submission
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tactic</mark> of tenderers to test their positions in tenders
	- Tenderers are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not really interested</mark>
- Reasons for imposing a DQ rule for incomplete submission
	- To ensure complete submission at tender return
- Drawbacks if this rule is strictly followed
	- May reduce the number of interested tenderers
	- May result in a lot of DQ if tenderers do not take the rule seriously, thereby affecting the success of the tender exercise
- Pitfalls if this imposed rule is subsequently relaxed
	- This will be unfair to those tenderers who have submitted complete information at tender return
	- In extreme cases, unsuccessful tenderers who submitted a set of complete information may lodge complaint against an award of the contract to a tenderer who supplemented his submission through the tender clarification process
	- If incomplete submission is to be tolerated, similar rules in future tendering will not be seriously respected and complied with by tenderers, thus ending up with the same problem of incomplete submission
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Pitfalls in inviting outstanding information after opening</mark> of tenders
	- Tenderers may try to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">manipulate</mark> their supplementary information <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">to their advantage</mark>
	- Tenderers may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">introduce new qualifications</mark> when answering requests for outstanding information
	- The above will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unfair</mark> to those tenderers who have submitted complete information at tender return
	- Consultants would have to spend more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time</mark> to deal with the above and may need to ask other tenderers again in the light of fresh information introduced by a tenderer to ensure fairness. A virtual <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-tendering</mark> is in place which may be subject to query <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if very strict accountability is to be followed</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Solution</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Distinguish</mark> between those submission which are really crucial and those which are not, and demand <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only for those which are crucial</mark>
	- Adopt <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">two-stage tendering</mark>: crucial information for assessment of tenders must be submitted at tender return, falling which the tenders will not be considered. Further, information that is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costly to prepare to be submitted after tender return upon the request</mark> of the Employer. By doing so, only these tenderers who have a high chance to be awarded will need to submit such information which is costly to prepare.
	- Clients who are not one-off developer should set up a track record to earn the trust of tenderers that tenderers' ideas, financial status, business secrets would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be disclosed</mark> to others and tender conditions will be consistently and fairly applied. However, this track record could only be established over time
	- Ask tenderers to submit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">some of the information during the pre-qualification</mark> process
	- Ensure that tenderers invited are really interested by giving them <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more advance information</mark> prior to formal tendering and by conducting a more thorough pre-qualification process
	- Allow a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable tendering period</mark>
