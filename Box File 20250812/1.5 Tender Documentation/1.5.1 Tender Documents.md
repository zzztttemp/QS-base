## Risk management in Pre-Contract Stage

- Risk is uncertainty
- Source of risk
	- Neutral
		- Policy, statutory requirement, change of law, 
		- Social unrest, natural disaster
		- Fluctuation, marker condition
		- Site condition, e.g. underground
	- Employer
		- Financial capability
		- Delay in decision-making, inadequate planning
			- Design change: undefined SOW, substantial VO change
			- Time change: extend tender validity extensively, late commencement, early partial possession
	- Contractor
		- Capability to deliver the works timely & to standard
		- Financial capability
		- Resource availability (labour, plant, material) (staff, subcon)
- Consequence of high risk on Contractor
	- Tenderers may decline the tender for unbearable risk
	- Underpricing of risk
		- Difficult in selecting competent tenderer, as bid with low allowance of risk is more likely to win
		- Affect MC's ability to perform and expose him to bankruptcy
		- MC will try to claim more elsewhere, possible dispute and delay
	- Overpricing of risk
		- Employer has to pay extra even if the risk might not happen or turned out to be less
- Good practice
	- Define clear parties' rights and obligations, SOW, requirements, and risks allocation; ensure comprehensive contract documentation
	- Provide sufficient information for Contractor to price risk, make sure awareness and inclusion
	- Balance of risk by Employer and Contractor
	- Comprehensive tender analysis
	- Communication, risk management & mitigation strategies, supervision & monitoring
	- Allow contingency in budgeting
	- Alleviation consequences of risk by insurance, bond, dispute resolution mechanism

## Past Paper Scenario

### See 1.2.3 for Design & Build

### A&A Works (2004 Q4Bi)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual</mark> 
	- Date for Possession needs to be amended to the effect that MC is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not actually taking possession</mark> of the lobbies, but to only commence work there
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Liability for indemnity against loss and damage to existing properties</mark> arising out of the carrying out of the works needs to be considered. E can either choose to take up the risk, or to ask C to indemnify him for such loss and damage
	- Requirement for the arrangement of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurances</mark> to match the liabilities for indemnity. This will include extending E's own Properties All Risk Policy with an endorsement to cover loss and damages as a result of the A&A works. Should C be required to provide the indemnity, section II of CAR will need to be extended to cover E's properties.
	- Possible <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">phased completion</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LD</mark> defined
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DLP</mark> defined as a fixed period from the completion of the last batch / different DLP for different phases
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">release of retention</mark> defined 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Payment</mark> in stages or by progress payment
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Preliminaries</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Access</mark> restriction including 
		- Restricted <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">use of lifts</mark> and staircases, e.g. designated lift for the works
		- Loading restriction on the use of lift
		- Responsibility for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra maintenance</mark> and repair and attendance <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">by lift maintenance contractor</mark>
	- Responsibility for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">protection of lifts</mark> and staircases and extent of protection required
	- Availability of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">temporary water and electricity</mark> from E's own source, or to be separately metered and charged back to C. Responsibility for temporary connection and fees and charges for consumption for the works
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Working hours</mark>, restriction on noisy works
	- Detail <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">control of workpeople</mark> in and out the estate and the residential towers
		- Use of an access control system including ID registration daily
		- Uniforms / ID badges to be worn at all times by workers on site
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Storage area</mark> availability, restriction on the size / location / loading restriction of the storage area
	- Temporary <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">protection of existing premises</mark> and liability for damage caused
	- Daily <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cleaning</mark> of debris arising from the works, daily cleaning after working hours
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In-house rules</mark>
	- Any requirement for a team of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">customers relationship</mark> officers to handle complaints and for daily arrangement

### Uncertain site possession date *(2011 D1Q3a)*

- Given possession of the site to MC is an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implied term of contract</mark>. It is also usually expressed. The Employer would be in breach of the Contract if he fails to give site possession. Some standard forms of contract provide for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark> in case of delay to agreed site possession date. Some forms are silent in this respect and this may make the time at large in case of delay.
- However, it is not uncommon that the exact site possession date is no known at the time of issuing the tender documents. 
- It is also not uncommon that the site possession date is purposely left unstated to make it flexible to suit the tender award date or the actual site availability.
- It is usual to specify the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contract Period as a period commencing from the actual site possession date</mark>, or a period having some relationship with the actual possession date, such that a fixed minimum construction period is available to the MC. Adjustment of the site possession date would have a corresponding adjustment of the completion date. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Specific EOT is therefore not required</mark>.
- If the site possession date is not specifically stated in the tender documents, it would be expected that the Contract would be awarded within the tender validity period, and the site <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">possession</mark> date should be, at the latest, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">within a reasonable time after the tender validity period</mark>.
- However, what would be considered as a reasonable time may lead to argument. Therefore, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a range of time during which the site possession date may occur</mark> would be specified in the tender documents for the tenderers to judge the implications of holidays, bad weather conditions, inflations, availability of labour, etc.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Review of this range of time</mark> may be made <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">during the tender evaluation stage</mark>. Private sector projects would be more relaxed to conduct negotiation in this respect during the tender evaluation stage. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Gov projects would be more stringent to permit</mark> adjustment of tender requirements and tender sums at this stage.
- If the actual site possession date is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">beyond</mark> the agreed range of time, then <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost and time compensation</mark> might be required.
- It may also be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specified</mark> in the tender documents that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay up to a certain limit beyond</mark> a specific site possession date or a specific range of time will have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no cost compensation</mark>. The tenderers would have to allow for such requirements.
- If it is anticipated that the extent of the delay can vary very much, the tenderers may be requested to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price separately for the daily rate of cost compensation</mark> for different extent of delay.
- The Contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">should not be awarded if there is still no prospect of making the site available</mark>. Otherwise, the Employer would be in serious breach of contract if the Contract cannot go ahead after award.

### Issues of FOT (input period, uncertain SOW, long tender validity) *(2012 D1Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contract name</mark> is incorrect
- Phase 1 works 
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Permitting the tenderers to suggest their own completion periods</mark> may enable <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tenderers to adopt their own best estimates</mark> of completion period. However, the suggested completion periods <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may be too long</mark> to be acceptable. It may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">necessary to specify the maximum period</mark>. Furthermore, different completion periods could <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">affect the tender prices</mark> as they would affect the way and duration of the Works are to be planned and carried out. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">evaluation of tenders</mark> will need to take into account the different cost effects of the different completion periods to the Employer on top of the tender sums.
	- Having <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uniform completion period</mark> would allow the tenderers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price the tenders on a uniform basis and allow comparison of tenders with one less variable</mark>. However, if the uniform completion period is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unrealistically</mark> too long or too short, tenderers may be forced to allow for unnecessary running costs or acceleration costs or even to factor in the damages for delay.
	- The existing clause does <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">not mention start date</mark> of the completion period. Depending on the definition given in the Tender Documents, the period may start from the Date of Possession / Commencement / Acceptance of tender.
- Phase 2 works
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Undefined scope of works and completion period</mark> generally increase <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks of uncertainty</mark>
	- Unable to quote
		- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not clear whether there are BQ or SOR for tenderers to quote</mark> for Phase 2 works. 
		- If no rates are to be quoted, tenderers may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price for the risks excessively and unnecessarily or may underprice</mark> for the risks. In a competitive tendering, underpricing is more likely to happen.
		- Reasonably priced <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preliminaries</mark> may turn out to be priced too high or too low if the actual scope and time <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviate very much from expectations</mark>, and if there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no mechanism for reasonable adjustment</mark> of such items. Substantial reduction in the scope would also cause under-recovery of overheads and profit.
		- In case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overpricing, the Employer cannot gain back</mark> even if the risks turn out to be less.
		- In case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">underpricing</mark>, the Contractor would try to find grounds to deviate from the quoted rates and prices by arguing that the actual scope and time are different from expectation. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer will face more claims</mark>.
	- Some tenderers may view the situation as an unbearable uncertainty, and may opt to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">decline tendering</mark>. 
	- Even if the pricing is normal, the uncertainties would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult for the Contractor to plan and schedule his works</mark> and resources effectively
	- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not entirely clear whether the extension is time-wise after Phase 1 works or scope-wise</mark> at any time during Phase 1 works. If the timing of instructing for Phase 2 works is unfavourable, the Employer may be expose to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">claims</mark> for disruptions, delays to completion, loss an expense.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Long tender validity period</mark>
	- A tender validity period of 12 months is considered as abnormally long.
	- As this is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed price contract</mark>, there is a tendency for tenderers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price for the extra costs due to price fluctuations</mark> in the tender.
	- It would be difficult for the tenderers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retain the proposed site staff and sub-contractors for that long period</mark>. Extra costs will be required to retain them.
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">availability of brands and models of materials</mark> proposed may also change.
	- The Employer will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">still need to pay the extra</mark> cost built in the tender sum <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">even though the long tender validity period eventually proves to be unnecessary</mark>
	- On the other hand, if the Contractor has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not allowed sufficient amount</mark> to cover price fluctuations and other extra costs, it would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">affect Contractor's ability to perform and even expose him to bankruptcy</mark>.
	- Some tenderers may view the situation as an unbearable uncertainty, and may opt to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">decline tendering</mark>.

### Design change & no dwg but tender first *(2017 D1Q4b)*

- Write into the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Tender Documents</mark> to clarify
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Basis of the design and quantities</mark> used for tendering
	- That the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">works are to be commenced based on BD approval residential design initially</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme for the availability of the construction drawings and BD approved drawings</mark> for the serviced apartment design after the commencement of the works
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extent that the Contactor has to accommodate</mark> in terms of time, cost and statutory compliance <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in case of a failure to obtain statutory approval</mark> or consent or a delay to the programme
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mechanism to evaluate the extra time and cost</mark> effects if the failure or delay is more severe than expected.
- Keep measuring <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">BQ</mark> exactly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on the present set of residential drawings</mark> to form a clear base for measuring the future change to serviced apartment
- Produce (by A and E) additional <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">specification</mark> for additional work items required for serviced apartment
- Produce (by A and E) <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">typical details</mark> for additional work items required for the serviced apartment
- Prepare a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SOR (or provisional BQ)</mark> to represent the additional work items to obtain rates <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for future pricing of variations</mark>
- Include a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cost-plus mechanism</mark> to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cover major items not coverable by SOR or provisional BQ</mark>
- Include the aforesaid into the Tender Documents and update where appropriate by means of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tender addenda or post tender clarifications</mark> until contract award
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Monitor the cost</mark> of the serviced apartment design <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">during its development</mark>
- Measure, value and agree the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">variations</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">as soon as</mark> the construction drawings for the serviced apartment are issued.

### Works outside site boundary (2022 D1Q3)


- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whether to extend site boundary</mark>
	- Although there is no defined term for site boundary, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Site</mark> is defined as "the land or other places provided by Employer for the purpose of carrying out of the Works" <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">under SFBC clause 1</mark>
	- It is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">common practice</mark> for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect to show the location</mark> and extent of the Site with boundary line, delineating the site boundary
	- It is a contractual responsibility for the Employer to give <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">possession</mark> of the Site to the Contractor on or before Date for Possession of the Site under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC clause 23.1</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Part B works</mark>, i.e., the builder's works for utility connections, are part of works to be carried out by Contractor but fall outside the site boundary
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the site boundary is extended</mark> to include the area of Part B works, the Employer will be obliged to give possession of the area for Part B works to Contractor, which Employer cannot fulfill such contractual requirement since he <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">does not possess</mark> the area which is outside the site boundary
	- If the Employer fails to give possession on the Date for Possession, the Employer is technically in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">breach of contract</mark> due to act of prevention, which will result in EOT, additional payment and even determination in worst case. Hence, it is not recommended to extend the site boundary to cover area where the Employer does not have possession.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Points to be included in the Tender Doc</mark>
	- Statements <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specifying clearly works outside site boundary</mark>, including their locations, extent and scope of works within the aid of drawings
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Restrictions</mark> for carrying out works outside site boundary such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no exclusive possession, working hours, traffic diversion, safety measures, statutory permits required, party responsible for applying for permits, interfacing or coordination works with other parties, etc</mark>.
	- Requirements for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reinstatement</mark> after the works are completed in that area
	- Reminder of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark> cover
	- Identification of the works to be carried out outside site boundary <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separately in BQ or SOR</mark> for pricing

### Milestone to handover to Lift Direct Contract (2024 D1Q3)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Incorporating lift installation programme</mark>
	- The at least <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">6-month period for lift installation should be specified</mark> in Main Contract with its starting date defined. It is usually counted <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">from the date of handover the lift shafts and lift pits</mark>. 
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expected handover date</mark> should be specified by means of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed calendar date or a date relative to the commencement date of the Contract</mark>. This date must be achievable by the lift contractor, after taking into account the date of award of the lift contract, pre-ordering activities, ordering and delivery time. 
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more than one date</mark> may need to be specified, if there are very different lifts at different locations.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Milestone or other provisions with LAD</mark>
	- A rate of LAD is usually specified in the Contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only for delay to the overall contract completion date or any specific sectional</mark> or phased completion date specified in the Contract. The names of such dates can vary between different standard forms of contract.
	- Except for those milestone dates representing those specific completion dates, rates of LAD are usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not specified for other milestone</mark> dates on the programmes. Missing those milestone dates may however be subject to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">general damages</mark>
	- To set a milestone date related to the lift installation with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD imposable, such a milestone date should be defined as a section</mark> or phase in accordance with the general conditions of the standard form of contract with LAD imposable but also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">with EOT entitlement</mark>, otherwise, a set of special conditions of contract to that effect should be included.
	- That <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">milestone date must be related to the expected handover date</mark>, not the 6-months period, though the 6-month period must also be specified.
	- Bonus: the 6-months period can be specified without the need to specify the milestone for handover because the Contractor will be obliged to afford the 6-month period even when the handover date is delayed.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Estimating the rate of LAD</mark>
	- In case of delay to the expected handover date, the likely loss and expense which may be suffered by Employer will be the amount payable to the lift contractor for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolonged off-site storage</mark> of the lifts in the absence of free on-site storage, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">second transportation</mark> to the site if the lifts could have been delivered directly to the site after arrival to Hong Kong, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inflationary</mark> effect on the installation costs, and some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolongation costs of the lift contractor's project staff</mark>, plus the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer's own administrative expenses</mark>.
	- Bonus: the rate of LAD should be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genuine pre-estimate of loss</mark> and expense which may be suffered by Employer due to the failure to meet the handover milestone date. If it is excessively more than that, it will not be enforceable.
	- Bonus: the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">benefit</mark> of such rate of LAD is to remove the need to substantiate the actual loss and expense incurred.
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the rate will likely be small</mark> as compared to the full rate of LAD for delay to the overall completion of the Main Contract Works and is unlikely to have a very forceful effect to push to achieve the milestone date. Much time will need to be spent to assess the EOT related to the milestone date.
	- Bonus: If the Contractor fails to meet the handover milestone date and cannot subsequently catch up the delay, he will also be liable for the LAD related to the delayed completion of the Main Contract Works. The build-ups of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">two rates LAD should not overlap</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Other financial or payment suggestion to ensure the milestone</mark>
	- Set up a milestone payment mechanism such that a portion of the payment will only be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">released upon the achievement of the milestone</mark>. If the milestone date is missed, the release of that portion will be deferred until achievement.
	- A more stringent version is to release upon the achievement of the milestone by the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specified milestone date</mark>. If the milestone date is missed, that portion will not be released. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However, that portion must eventually be released at some later specified stage</mark> (e.g. completion of the whole of the Works), otherwise, that portion of payment may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">viewed as a penalty not enforceable</mark>.
	- An even more stringent method is to calculate that portion of payment based on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">period of delay to the milestone</mark> until the milestone is achieved. Similarly, the amount shall be released later, but can be used to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">set off any LAD imposable</mark> upon delayed completion of the whole of the Main Contract Works.
	- The above assumes that the portion of payment is part of the original Contract Sum but released subject to conditions. Instead of delaying the release, the opposite is to offer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">incentive payment</mark> on top of the original Contract Sum for on-time achievement of the milestone date with full or very limited grounds for EOT.
	- Bonus: in all the above cases, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect will have to certify</mark> the achievement or non-achievement of the milestones.
