### Reasons for including FOT *(2012 D1Q3a)*

- FOT is intended to provide a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">uniform format for the tenderers to state their offers</mark>, in terms of tender sums and completion period, for the Works that the Employer may wish to be executed
- FOT <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lists out the documentary basis of the tender offers</mark>, e.g. CC, dwg, spec, BQ / SOR, etc., so as to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure no future argument</mark> over the basis of the tender offers.
- FOT requires the offeror to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">state clearly his identity and sign</mark> FOT by an authorized signatory
- FOT states the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">validity period of the offer</mark>, which means that offeree may accept the offer at any time within such period. Any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unqualified acceptance of the offer would become a binding contract</mark>.
- Serve functions like:
	- Give opportunity for stating <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">alternative offers</mark> in a specified manner
	- Require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">acknowledgement</mark> of SCC, TA, particulars to be inserted in Appendix to CC, and other <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">important contractual terms</mark>
	- Require declaration of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">undertaking to provide bond or warranty</mark> in a specified form
	- Require acknowledgement that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">offeree is not bound to accept</mark> the lowest or any offer 
	- Require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">information</mark> on registered address, business registration certificate number, names of partners in case of a partnership, etc.

### Duplicate / Alternative FOT *(2012 D1Q3b)*

- A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">duplicate</mark> copy of FOT may be required to be submitted so that the Employer may keep it <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for record</mark> purposes when the Consultants are keeping the tenders for analysis, or for long term record purposes by another department.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Alternative</mark> FOT may be required if it is desired to have a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separate FOT each capable of being accepted for alternative proposals</mark> such as alternative tenders for different SOW / contract period / design proposal from tenderer / fluctuation clause.
