### Implication of Substantial Completion *(2024 D1Q3)*

- Completion of the Works means <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">substantial completion</mark> under SFBC
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Clause 1 defines</mark> Substantial Completion to mean the state of completion where the Works have been substantially completed to the Architect's satisfaction, have passed the required inspection and tests, may not absolutely completed or entirely free from defects, but can be taken over and used by Employer for their intended purpose, without unreasonable interreference or interruption by the completion of outstanding work or rectification of the defects.
- It is the responsibility of the Architect to issue the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Substantial Completion Certificate</mark> under SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">17.1</mark> when the above conditions are fulfilled. He may attach or issue separately a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">list of outstanding work and defects</mark> notifying the Contractor to complete or even requiring an undertaking from the Contractor to complete with or without times specified.
- The Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">liability for LAD</mark> for delayed completion ceases to run upon the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate
- Soon after the issuance of the Substantial Completion Certificate, the Employer should take over the Works noting that the Contractor's responsibility for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">care of the Works will end upon 14 days under clause 2.1(h).</mark> The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark> cover for the loss or damage to the Works, if taken out by the Contract, will also cease at the same time. If the Employer fails to take over beyond those 14 days, he should be liable for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">care and insurance</mark> of the Works.
- The Contractor has an implied duty to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clear away and leave the site</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DLP</mark> starts to run after Substantial Completion
- The period for completion of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final account</mark> starts to run after Substantial Completion
- Half of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retention</mark> shall be released
- If surety <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bond</mark> is required and is to expire upon Substantial Completion, it shall be released 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Instead of regular monthly certificates</mark>, interim payment certificate shall only be issued when further amounts are due to the Contractor under clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">32.1(3)</mark>
- The above are applicable whether the completion is earlier or later than the Substantial Completion Date because all of them are hinged on the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate

## Sectional Completion

- Architect to issue Substantial Completion Cert (cl.17.2(1))
- Architect to issue Defect Rectification Cert (cl.17.5(1))
- Employer take partial possession of completed section (cl.18.1(1))
- Adjust LAD for remaining section (cl.18.4)
- Insurance period for section (cl.22.4(2))
- Contractor's duty to complete on time (cl.23.2)

## Leave Unfinished Works after Completion
### Architect treat outstanding as defect to avoid EOT (2005 Q1D1)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A's intention</mark>
	- By certifying completion in spit of the outstanding works caused by his late instruction had the effect of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">avoiding the granting of EOT for such reason, and the associated L&E</mark> that may result
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Validity of "outstanding items"</mark>
	- Valid if one relating to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">de minimius and trivial defects rectification not affecting the beneficial</mark> occupation of the Employer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC allows</mark> outstanding works to be completed as soon as practicable during DLP. No explicit definition of what nature of works could be covered by the A's outstanding work list, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implied terms i.e. fit for intended purpose</mark> and ready for Employer's beneficial use, and "de minimius" principle. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Render completion cert questionable if relating to those which do affect beneficial</mark> occupation
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost and time for outstanding works</mark>
	- A's intentional leaving certain outstanding works to be carried out after completion would entitle MC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost reimbursement for any extra preliminaries and/or expenses</mark> genuinely incurred. This however has to be distinguished from those resources which MC would otherwise be responsible to provide during DLP for defects rectification. Also, such work will be completed <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">within a reasonable time only</mark>.

### Leave works after completion *(2010 D2Q4.B)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Valid ground for substantial completion</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.1.6</mark> defines "substantially completed".
	- Usually it is the MC who wishes to have the works certified substantially completed as soon as the works the works can be taken over and used by Employer for their intended purpose. The Architect cannot refuse the certification because of the presence of some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">minor unfinished items</mark> of work. Therefore, the definition if for the protection of the MC. However, it does not mean that the definition cannot be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">used for the benefit of the Employer</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.17.1</mark>, the Architect can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">certify substantial completion</mark> when he considers that the state has been reached. There is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no expressed need for MC to apply</mark>.
	- Since all the statutory inspections of the building have already been completed, the building is scheduled for handover in 4 weeks' time for occupation and use, with the wallpaper <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">left as the only outstanding</mark> original contract work, there is no reason why the Architect cannot certify substantial completion at the same time and require the wallpaper to be completed later.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Avoid EOT claim</mark>
	- MC would insist on treating the wallpaper work as an inseparable part of the works to be completed before substantial completion in cases where <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">he wants to rely on the EOT to help his other delays</mark>. The Architect cannot certify substantial completion as long as the building is not ready for handover due to MC's delay but once the delay is finished, the Architect can do so without waiting for the wallpaper work. MC's wish to rely on the delay to the wallpaper work may not be realised.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">An expressed instruction that the wallpaper work will be postponed after substantial completion</mark> or a notice that the wallpaper work will be omitted from the Contract if MC challenges the right to postpone will prevent MC to have wishful thinking of relying on the delay to the wallpaper work to save his own delays.
	- While the validity of the postponement and the omission may be an issue, any adverse implication would be outweighed by the benefit of taking over the building for use earlier
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Practical issues</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark> policies would usually cover the rectification of defects or the carrying out of outstanding work during DLP. Practically, there is seldom need to have any extra agreement to deal with such outstanding work. Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">protection</mark> work or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">safety</mark> precautions may be required for the carrying out of wallpaper work after substantial completion because tenants have already moved in.

## Early Completion

- Contractor may choose to complete earlier but not obliged to handover the site earlier
- Architect or other consultants have no obligation to issue drawings earlier for earlier completion
- Benefit
	- Early occupation by Employer
	- Contractor to get bond & retention release for cash flow
- Good practice
	- Parties to agree at an early stage

### Early completion and handover *(2024 D2Q3)*


- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Refusal to take over upon completion before Completion Date</mark>
	- By SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">23.2</mark>, Contractor is obliged to carry out and completion the Works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on or before</mark> the Completion Date, but there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no contract provision requiring</mark> the Contractor to keep the Works until the Completion Date. In other words, the Contractor is allowed to complete the Works before the Completion Date and hand over the Works to the Employer. "Completion Date" includes "extended Completion Date" or "Date for Completion" or "Time for Completion"
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC does not have an express provision for Employer to take over</mark> the Works upon completion of the Works, but clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2.1(1)(h)</mark>, the Contractor's responsibility for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">care of the Works shall end upon 14 days after Substantial Completion</mark> of the Works. This means that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer should take over within these 14 days</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Practical implication to Employer</mark>
	- Specific <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">practical implication</mark> to the Employer related to completion earlier than the Completion Date include:
		- Arrangement for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inspection</mark> earlier than planned
		- Arrangement for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operational training</mark> earlier than planned
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mobilization of building management staff</mark> earlier than planned
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Marketing and advertising</mark> for sales or rental earlier than planned
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Changing the agreed sales handover dates or rental start dates</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Moving in</mark> earlier than planned
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Releasing retention</mark> earlier than planned
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Financial burden</mark> in connection with the above
