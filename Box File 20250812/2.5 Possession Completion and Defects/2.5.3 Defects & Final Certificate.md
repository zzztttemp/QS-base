## Concept

- Defective works
    - Works fails to comply with the terms of contract
    - A breach of contract
    - Remedy under contract
    - Remedy under common law
	    - Loss & damage arise naturally from breach and reasonably in contemplation of parties at the time of contracting
- De minimis principle
    - Rectify minor defects in DLP
    - All unfinished items of works shall be completed as soon as practicable after the issue of the Substantial Completion Certificate, or as instructed by the Architect, and in any case before the expiry of the Defects Liability Period (cl. 17.1)
 - Establish liability
	- Defect or damage
		- Causation & person to blame
		- Time of causation, time of revealing
		- Joint inspection to identify cause and liability
		- Not liable for damage by Specified Peril after SC (cl.17.6)
			- Specified Peril is defined in cl.1.6 as "lightning, explosion, storm, tropical cyclone, flood, bursting or overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes, earthquake, aircraft and other aerial devices or articles dropped from them"
		- Not liable for damage caused by persons for whom Employer is responsible
	- Contract specification & warranty in Contract
	- Warranty by specialist
		- Employer can directly approach for redress
	- Completion Certificate / passing test not relieve liability
		- A proof that Architect is satisfied that the Works have been substantially completed
		- Not prove the Works are free from minor or latent defects before issuing the Certificate
		- Not relive from defects liability found during DLP
		- No Architect cert except Final Cert provide evident of compliance (cl.32.12)
	- Final Cert & Defects Rectification Cert exclude latent defect & warranty
- Release of liability
	- No liability
		- Damage from Excepted Risk (cl.2.1(h))
	- Substantial Completion
		- Care of works (cl.2.1(h))
		- Damage by Specified Peril (cl.17.6)
	- Defects Rectification Certificate / Final Certificate
		- Patent defects (cl.17.7, cl.32.9(1))
	- Remain
		- Latent defect (cl.17.7, cl.32.9(2))
		- Warranty
## Defects Rectification

- DLP 12 months usually
	- 12 months cover the four seasons
	- Some property sales and purchase agreement stipulate 12 months DLP
	- Sometimes 6 months for hoarding and demolition
- Architect to list in schedules of defects (cl. 17.3)
	- Identify cause of defects
		- By Contractor's default, natural causes, or Specified Peril
    - Cost of investigating defects borne by Employer
    - Not later than 14 days after DLP
    - If defect not in schedule of defects
	    - Not rule out the obligation under contract nor common law in rectification
- Contractor to rectify defects (cl. 17.3)
    - Condition
        - By own default, natural causes, or Specified Peril
        - Occur during the construction period prior to SC
        - No obligation if by Specified Peril after SC
    - Contractual liability
	    - Patent defects before expiry of DLP
	    - Latent defects before limitation period
		- Special warranty requirements
			- By supplier directly or in the joint name of Contractor to Employer
	- Tort law liability or statutory liability
		- Towards future owners, tenants, public, etc. 
    - Rectify within reasonable time
- Fail to rectify (cl. 17.3)
    - Employer might engage others
	    - Practice
		    - Prior warning and notice before engagement
		    - Reasonable mitigation if any further damage
		    - Ensure reasonable cost by calling several quotations
		    - Keep detailed records of defects and exact work done by an independent party e.g. architect
		    - Rectify to the same standard as the contract to avoid argument of design defect
		- Justification
			- MC has been given a reasonable opportunity to rectify, and lose the right to rectify himself by failing to do so
		- Effect
			- MC remains liable
			- Not a waiver of MC's breach
			- Cost can be set off against the retention monies
	    - Pitfall if no Final Certificate
		    - Difficult to prove who causes subsequent defects
		    - Risk of facing two arbitrations
    - Or AI to accept defects and reasonable deduction to contract sum
    - Employer might terminate MC if refuse to comply with AI (cl.35.1(c))
- Method of control
	- Defective works not to be paid in IP, not properly executed (cl.32.2(4))
	- Retention residue release on expiry of DLP (cl.32.5)
	- Final Certificate is conclusive that the works have been completed in accordance with the contract (cl.32.9)
	- Bond but burden of proof on Employer
- Cost of investigating defects
	- Borne by Employer since the duty to prepare schedule of defects on Architect
 
## Defects Rectification Certificate

- Condition (cl. 17.4)
    - DLP expired
    - Satisfactory completion of all uncompleted work
    - Satisfactory rectification of all defects
- Sectional completion (cl. 17.5)
    - Separate cert
    - Cert for the Works upon DLP to last Section
- Implication
    - Discharge Contractor from further obligation for defects (cl. 17.7)
    - Not discharge Contractor's obligation under a warranty, not prejudice to Employer's other rights and obligations (cl. 17.7)
    - Release of the residue of Retention (cl. 32.5)
    - Final Account could be settled (cl. 32.6)
    - End of Architect's power to issue AI / VO (cl. 4.1)
    - Issue Final Certificate asap (cl.32.8(1))
- Excluded from release
	- Latent defects and warranty
 
## Final Certificate

- Architect to issue at least 28 days after FA (cl. 32.8)
- Implication (cl. 32.9)
    - Conclusive evidence
        - Materials, goods, workmanship and work were in compliance
        - All adjustment to the Contract Sum made in FA
        - All EOT given
        - LE in full and final settlement
    - Exception
        - Fraud, dishonesty or fraudulent concealment
        - Latent defects
        - Design defects for D&B
    - Not prejudice common law rights and remedies regarding defective work
 
## Common law remedies for defects

- Principle
	- Defect clause in Contract does not bar from common law remedies (cl.17.7, 32.9(2))
	- Defect is a breach of Contract
- Entitlement of remedy 
	- Loss & damage arise naturally from breach and reasonably in contemplation of parties at the time of contracting
	- Reasonable mitigation of loss
- Defects discovered after DLP
    - Cannot AI to rectify
    - Only remedy by action of damages for breach of contract
- Limitation period 
	- Limitation Ordinance Cap 347 (HK) / Latent Damage Act 1980 (UK)
	- Contract claim
		- 6 years from the date of breach for simple contract
		- 12 years from the date of breach for deed
	- Tort claim
		- 6 years from the damage occurred
		- Extension for latent damage
			- 3 years from the date of knowledge
			- Definition of knowledge
				- Sufficient confidence to justify embarking on the preliminaries to the issue of a writ
				- But not necessary to identify conclusively
			- Successive owner
				- Fresh period if he had no knowledge of the damage
		- Long stop limit
			- 15 years from the date of the act, regardless of when it was discovered
- Diminution in value of completed building (out of proportion)
    - If the remedy & reinstatement cost is out of proportion to the extent of defective works
    - Ruxley Electronics v Forsyth (1995) - swimming pool wrong depth
    - Difference between should have been delivered & actually delivered
	- Potential loss of amenity if no diminution in market value
- Pure economic loss from defective property is non-recoverable
	- Murphy v Brentwood DC (1991)

## Special Scenario

- Latent defect
    - Concept
        - A hidden flaw or defect in the workmanship, design, materials or construction of a building that is not visible or patent to a competent person
	- Defect found after DLP
	    - Remedy under common law for breach of contract
    - Limitation period
        - See common law remedies for defects
- Further defect after rectification
	- Contractor's liability
- Defects getting worse / cause further damage
	- Employer mitigate without unreasonable delay
	- Notify Contractor immediately
	- Keep good records and monitor the position carefully
	- Once defect is rectified, claim additional cost
- Unable to rectify defect within a reasonable time
	- Client may claim damages due to the delay
	- Slow progress not sufficient ground to employ others
		- Archi to specify a reasonable time for completion
		- Serve a note before employing others
		- Select competitive price to avoid Contractor's challenge
	- DLP cert & retention
- Not allowed to rectify defect in normal hours
	- Need appreciation of reasons
	- Dispute on additional cost
	- Propose compromised solution for agreement
- Defect appeared in DLP but overlook by Architect
	- Contractor still liable under common law
	- Employer may engage others and contra-charge the Contractor
		- If not notify Contractor but could have, cost limited to the what would have been incurred by Contractor
	- Might sue Architect for negligence

### Contractor use alternative but defect (1999 Q 4 c)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor ought to </mark>
	- Have obtained formal approval to the use of K <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">before installation</mark>
	- Have obtained formal approval for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">repair work</mark> to be carried out with local material
	- Proceed with repair work in local material only after approval was given
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Architect should have</mark>
	- Drawn the client's attention that the catalogue of K was offered <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">during the site visit</mark>
	- Made his choice clear to the contractor<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> before delivery</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Upon delivery of visible damage</mark>, made known to the contractor what action was required: e.g.
		- To be replaced by W
		- Whether contractor should carry out the repair work
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Discussion</mark>
	- Whether W is specified as '<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">W or equivalent</mark>'?
	- If W is not nominated, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">architect may accept equivalent</mark> products in equivalent standard
	- With <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">understanding that the client has selected K,</mark> Architect should not insist on W
	- Contractor could have a back to back agreement to back-<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">charge at his sub-contractor / supplier for the cost of making good</mark>
	- Whether <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remedial work </mark>utilising local material constitute <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">equivalent</mark> standard to W?
	- Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rationale in offering alternative</mark> of K to the client e.g. due to cost / availability?
	- Suggestion to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">settle the dispute by negotiation / commercial settlement with client</mark> using K (cost / availability) e.g. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remedial works / reasonable deduction of contract sum</mark>
	- It can be argued that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect, by action, have accepted K</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor is not entitled to claim</mark> extra payment for the repair
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect may insist on having equivalent standard</mark> to those of W

### Action against Defects in Different Contract Stages (2001 Q 4)

- Question
	- A piece of external wall finish has fallen off from a building. Explain how you would advise the architect of his contractual position if the above is discovered
		- Before substantial completion is certified
		- During DLP
		- Immediately after expiry of DLP
		- After issue of Final Certificate
- Answer
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">For all 4 situation, the following actions are required from QS</mark>:-
		- Write to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect</mark> requesting their comment as to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cause of incident</mark>, whether it is defective works or covered by insurance, etc.
		- Refer to the report compiled by COW for the exact<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> location and extent of the works affected</mark>
		- Check with Architect <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the incident has caused further damage</mark> to person, property and remaining works
		- Check with Architect <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether any remedial measures are to be taken</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the incident is caused by one of the contingencies as referred to in the CAR insurance</mark> policy, the insurer should be informed and documentary evidence be submitted for their assessment of the loss sustained thereby. The damages received from the insurer should be paid in accordance with clause 20 of SFBC.
	- While if the incident is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">caused by poor workmanship and defined as defective works</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Before substantial completion</mark>
			- Architect may issue an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">instruction</mark> required MC to remove the defective works and make good the same to his satisfaction. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If MC fails</mark> to do so, the Architect may appoint others to carry out the works and deduct the expenses due to MC.
			- QS should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exclude the defective works from IP</mark> until the same is made good.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">During DLP</mark>
			- Same as before substantial completion, but the only available recourse is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retention</mark> monies withheld
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">After expiry of DLP but before Final Certificate</mark>
			- If the defective work was not included in the Schedule of Defects delivered to MC during DLP, and it does not fall within the definition of 'latent defects', the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect in essence waived his right to instruct MC to rectify</mark> the same. 
			- It is also doubtful whether he may adjust the Final Account Sum for those defects which ought reasonably be revealed within DLP
			- QS is obliged to adjust the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Final Contract Sum</mark> accordingly
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">After issue of Final Certificate</mark>
			- Unless latent defects, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Final Certificate is conclusive evidence</mark> that MC has discharged his obligations under the Contract. The Employer is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not entitled to recover</mark> the cost of rectification works under the Contract
			- Employer may take action under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common law for breach</mark> of contract, and sue Architect for negligence. Under the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limitation ordinance</mark>, actions could be brought within 6 years for a simple contract from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or within 12 years for deed under seal.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Latent defects</mark> however are exceptions to (3) & (4), and the cost of rectification work should be borne by MC provided the limitation period is not expired

### Damage to curtain wall by typhoon after SC *(2011 D2Q1)* 

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Identify damage or defect</mark>
- For damage caused by typhoons after Substantial Completion, MC is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">usually not liable</mark>. However, since it is an external glazing, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">further investigation should be required</mark>. It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">usually for the Contract to specify</mark> that the external glazing should withstand typhoons, which are a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common natural phenomenon</mark> in Hong Kong. An external glazing which cannot withstand typhoons can be regarded as a non-compliance with the Contract, and MC should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">liable to rectify</mark> the damage as his defects. 
- However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if the damage was caused by a flying object</mark> caused by typhoon, it would appear beyond the performance requirements to withstand the natural typhoon forces, and MC should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be liable</mark> for the damage.

### Water leakage after typhoon before handover, but cert issued *(2012 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SC date not necessary the handover date</mark>
- The water leakage found before SC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">might have been rectified and found satisfactory by the time of issuing the SC Cert</mark>, and it should be noted that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SC Cert cannot be unreasonably withheld for minor defects</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contract may exclude liability for damage caused by typhoons occurring after SC</mark>. It should be noted that his refers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">damage, not defects</mark>. It is usual for the Specification to impose a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design or performance liability</mark> such that the glass canopy will be able to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">withstand severe weather conditions</mark> which may likely be encountered. Therefore, if the glass canopy cannot withstand the heavy rainfall, MC & NSC have a duty to prove or counter-prove that the cause exceeded the specified performance requirements and the effect amounted to a damage, or to prove that they are not taking up any design or performance liability at all.
- Contractually, the following <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">course of actions</mark> may be adopted for the Employer:
	- Carry out a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">site inspection</mark> by the Architect, Contractor and NSC to identify the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extent and cause</mark> of leakage
	- Ascertain that the leakage is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a defect or as a result of other causes</mark> for which the Contractor and NSC are not responsible
	- Issue <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI to MC and NSC to rectify such defect</mark> as cl.17. 
	- Ask MC and NSC to provide a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defect rectification proposal with methodology and programme</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Appoint others to carry out if MC & NSC fail</mark> to rectify, and make deduction from payment due
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Resort to indemnity under Form of Warranty, guarantee or surety bond</mark> provided by NSC if NSC fails to perform those responsibilities for which the MC is not responsible, such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design responsibility</mark>

### Long DLP for Lift NSC (2015 D1Q3)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Lift NSC 36m, MC 12m</mark>
	- A sub-contract is formed between MC and NSC and there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no privity of contract</mark> between E and NSC.
		- Governed by the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">chain of responsibility</mark> formed among E, MC and NSC, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">E could enforce his rights to have the defects of NSC rectified against MC</mark> instead of directly against NSC. Likewise, MC is duty bound to respond to E's request for rectification of defects including those of NSC. E may have another means to directly approach NSC if a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Form of Warranty</mark> is given by NSC to E.
		- To maintain the chain of responsibility between MC and NSC, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DLP of NSC should be the same</mark> as consistent with that of MC.
	- To entertain the request but maintain the consistency, DLP of MC may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-defined as 36 months for NSC and 12 months for the rest of MC</mark>, permitting release of the last retention in two parts which may be apportioned according to values of works.
		- If <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">surety bond</mark> required to be provided by MC is to be released upon the satisfactory expiry of DLP instead of upon substantial completion, it may also be specified that the bonded amount can be partially reduced upon the expiry of the 12 months DLP of the rest of MC. The surety bond required to be provided by NSC under Form of Warranty would still be retained until the satisfactory expiry of the 36 month DLP.
		- Lifts will require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">periodical maintenance</mark> and repair service after the completion of the works, such service is different from rectification of defects, and is usually required under another contract provision. It should be specified that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NSC will need to provide that service as well for the extended period of DLP</mark>. NSC will factor that in the tender sum, but this is not really an extra because the cost would need to be spent anyway. 
		- It is therefore contractually feasible to entertain the request but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Conditions of MC and NSC would need to be amended to suit</mark>, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender sum of NSC should be expected to increase</mark>.
	- As an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">alternative</mark> to the above, since it is normal to required NSC to provide a Form of Warranty to Employer, MC DLP may still be kept as normal, while <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra 24 months DLP of NSC may be stipulated in Form of Warranty</mark>. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">drawback</mark> would be the MC's and NSC's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retention would be released</mark> upon expiry of the first 12 months. However, since the NSC will have an interest to secure the contract for the long term maintenance and repair service for the lifts, there should be an incentive for NSC to perform. If there is no confidence that NSC will perform, then it should not be invited to tender in the first place.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Lift NSC & MC 36m</mark>
	- Changing DLP of whole MC to 36 months will
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Affect MC and all NSC</mark>, DSC
		- Increase <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of rectification</mark> since more defects will appear during extended period
		- Defer the time of release of last <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">retention</mark> money and release of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bond</mark>
		- Lengthen the period of third party <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark> and ECI
		- Increase the likelihood of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delayed settlement of final accounts</mark> pending completion of defects
	- For lifts and MEP works which usually have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">periodical maintenance</mark> and repair service to be paid for, the extra cost of rectification are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not really an extra</mark> by comparison, but the drawbacks of earlier payment as discussed above should be noted.
	- For other works which do not usually have periodical maintenance and repair service to be paid for, MC and subcon will have to allow for the costs of rectification as an extra over the normal. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Products which have short life expectancy</mark> may need to be released and would be expected to be replaced within the extended period of DLP though this may not strictly be a defect.
	- The deferred release of retention money will cause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra financing charges on retention</mark> money for extended period
	- The deferred release of the surety bond will cause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra premiums</mark> for the extended period. However, non-release of the surety bond would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lock up MC and subcon's credit facilities</mark> and this would affect their financial and tendering capabilities. They may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deterred from tendering</mark>.
	- Product warranty periods often run after installation or substantial completion. The lengthening of DLP would make <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DLP overlap the warranty periods</mark> more. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Specialized products may have shorter standard warranty period</mark>
	- Extended DLP also extends provision of consultancy services by consultants, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">additional consultant fees</mark> will be required.
	- Extended DLP may give Contractor an impression of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no urgency in rectifying defects</mark>.
	- Therefore, not recommended.

### Damage to work after completion *(2019 D2Q4a)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Damage to works after completion</mark>
	- MC should firstly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">find out the cause and the party responsible</mark> for the bursting of the existing cold water pipe
	- As it is an existing cold water pipe, it is unlikely that MC is responsible for providing it, but it should be checked whether MC has done anything affecting it so as to cause the bursting
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.17.6</mark>, bursting of pipes after substantial completion is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specified peril</mark> relieving the Contractor from responsibility. However, it should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be interpreted to exclude intentional or accident acts on the part of Contractor</mark>.
	- Bonus: the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">standard clause has not addressed the issue</mark> of bursting caused by improper materials or workmanship on the part of the Contractor before substantial completion.
	- If MC is not responsible, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC may refuse</mark> to carry out the remedial work after substantial completion of the relevant section. If MC would like to do it, to avoid doubt, MC should ask Employer for a clear written <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">instruction</mark> with an understanding to pay. The work may be treated as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation or a separate order</mark>.

## Reasons for Contract Mechanisms Failure Regarding Defects

- Liability
	- Dispute liability by blaming Architect's design, etc.
- Common standard in industry
- Interpretation
	- Specification wording open to interpretation, and cannot be precisely measured
- Competitive tendering
	- Cut corner to gain profit
- Cash flow 
	- Employer may begin holding LD around the time of OP, cash flow stops flowing from Employer to Contractor, thus making good defects slows
- Supervision
	- Architect usually leave identification of defects at a very late stage
	- Sometimes leave identification of defects to purchaser
- Time
	- Unrealistic contract period
- Sub-contracting
	- Multi-layered sub-contracting regime hard to manage and control

## Good Practice for Employer

- Tender
	- Choose reputable contractors
	- Performance bond
	- Warranty or guarantee to some specific material
	- Release bond & half retention after Defects Rectification Certificate
	- Additional provision: MC to provide a written undertaking before SC to finish outstanding works within an agreed period (Swire)
	- Additional provision: Employer to employ others if in the opinion of Architect that it is more suitable and beneficial that remedial work is to be rectified by others
	- Existing provision: employer others; accept defective works
	- Extend DLP (cost increases)
- Construction
	- Material samples, sample floor, mock-up before incorporation into the Works
	- AI to open up for inspection when necessary
	- AI to replace defective works when necessary
	- Hold reasonable amount in IP if works are defective
	- Timely inspection, regular site meeting, etc.
	- Protective measures over completed works
	- Terminate if fail to comply with AI or appoint others if Contractor fails to rectify defects
- DLP
	- Architect to prepare Schedule of Defects & identify cause of defects 
	- AI for defects rectification
	- Appoint others if Contractor fails to rectify defects
	- Notify Contractor consequence to speed up rectification
	- Reasonable mitigation to defects to reduce loss
	- Insurance claim 
		- Third party for parts affected by defects 
		- Property insurance
	- Contract and common law remedies
	- In case of dispute
		- Appoint an independent party to establish the cause of defects
		- Dispute resolution

### C's defect after SC cause subsequent contractor's claim (2014 D2Q2c)

- Defective work means a Contractor's failure to comply with the express or implied terms of the Contract, hence it is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">breach</mark> of contract by the Contractor.
	- Contractor's rectification of defects following contract requirements would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not prejudice Employer's other rights and remedies under the common law</mark> regarding breach of contract.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.32.9(1)</mark> affords a relief to the Contractor for defects which could reasonably have been but have not been discovered upon the issue of the Defects Rectification Certificate. On the other hand, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.17.7 & 32.9(2)</mark> expressly preserves the Employer's common law right notwithstanding the issue of Defects Rectification Certificate.
	- Apart from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rectification of the defects</mark>, Contractor shall be liable for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss or damage</mark> which arises naturally from a breach of contract and reasonably in contemplation of both parties at the time of contracting
- Whether the Employer is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">entitled</mark> to recover the full amount of loss and expense will depend on:
	- Whether C should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonably have known</mark> about the subsequent contract, aware of the possible consequential damage and liabilities incurred by Employer to subsequent contract
	- Whether Employer has acted <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonably to mitigate the loss</mark>
- Apart from the entitlement, whether the Employer will actually be able to recover the entitled amount subsequent contractor would be another matter since C would most likely expect to rectify the defects only without additional liability.
