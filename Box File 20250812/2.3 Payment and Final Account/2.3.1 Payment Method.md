## Progress Payment

- Concept
    - Valuation made according to progress of work
    - Implications of defects, delay, variations, MOS, fluctuation, L&E, retention can be taken into account in each payment
- Application
    - Most commonly adopted
- Advantages
    - Most Contractors are familiar with
    - Require little modification to CC, shorten time for tender preparation
    - Payment relates directly with workdone
    - MOS valued
    - Less dispute on value of workdone
- Disadvantages
    - Require a regular and substantial input from QS for valuation
    - No linkage between payment and key completion dates
 
## Deposit / Advance Payment

- Concept
    - A portion of Contract Sum is paid upon the award of contract as a security to facilitate MC to procure materials
    - Some contracts specify
        - If repudiation by Employer, deposit is to be forfeited
        - If repudiation by MC, refund deposit in double
    - Recovery of deposit
        - Pro-rata to the progress value of workdone
- Application
    - Supply contract, Lift, fit-out, minor works
- Advantages
    - Better cash flow for Contractor
    - Necessary to secure small contractors or specialist contractors
- Disadvantages
    - Possible overpayment at the end of Contract
- Recommendation
    - Increase amount of surety bond to cover the deposit
    - Advance payment bond as security
    - Rate of recovery of deposit payment quicker than rate of workdone
    - Recovery of deposit payment related to time rather than workdone
 
## Stage Payment

- Concept
    - Works are broken down into a number of stages of completion each with a value which will be paid on completion of the relevant stage of works
- Application
    - Supply contract, Lift, fit-out, minor works, civil engineering, public facilities
    - For contracts with easily define stages
    - For contracts with simple nature
    - If do not want to spend time to value workdone
- Advantages
    - Simple to operate
    - Less time to value interim payment
    - Definite cash flow
    - Encourage completion of stage
- Disadvantages
    - If the definition of stages are too rigid, may result in non-achievement of the stages and non-payment
    - If the definition of stages are too loose, the value assigned for the stage may exceed the extent of workdone
    - Substantial changes in the sequence of works may disturb the original logic of the stage payment terms
    - Not suitable for complex projects with more design and programme changes
- Recommendation
    - Definitions of stages should be realistic with margin or interpretation
    - Minimize post contract changes
    - State that in case the cumulative total of stage payments deviates from the value of actual workdone by a certain %, payment will be based on the latter
    - Re-agree terms as appropriate
- QS's input in Front Part
    - CC: period of Interim Certificate & retention not applicable, refer to payment terms

### Stage payment *(2019 D1Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Stage payment</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Mechanism</mark>
		- A stage payment <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">schedule is included in Tender Documents</mark> whereby thw works are broken down into various stages for the purposes of payment and the amount against each stage will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">paid</mark> only upon the completion of the stage. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">schedule may also be agreed ad-hoc</mark> after the return of tenders.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Usually</mark>, payment will be made based on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stages completed by regular payment valuation dates</mark>. If there are only a few stages, payments may be paid as and when a stage is completed independent of any regular payment valuation dates.
		- The most <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stringent arrangement is to link the stage payment to a milestone date</mark> whereby the stage payment will be made only if the milestone date is met but this will increase the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financial burden</mark> and will trigger claims for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adjustment of the milestone date</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Basis of the amounts payable</mark>
		- Tenders are invited with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BQ provided to the tenderers or SOR submitted by tenderers</mark>. The use of a stage payment schedule would not affect the tender documentation time or tendering time.
		- The amount payable against each stage will be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pre-fixed percentage</mark> of Contract Sum or a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sum linked to the priced BQ or SOR</mark> or a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lump sum with no link</mark> at all.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Relevance to programme</mark>
		- The stages may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be closely related</mark> to the programme activities of Contractor
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cash flow expectation</mark>
		- The cash flow requirements and expectation for both parties are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more definite</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Motivation</mark>
		- In order to receive payment, Contractor is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">motivated to complete</mark> each stage to the fullset extent
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Ease of implementation</mark>
		- If the stage payments are specified in the form of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed percentages and fixed lump sums</mark>, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valuation for payment</mark> based on the achievement of the specified criteria will be very <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">easy</mark>
		- If the stage payments are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">links to priced BQ or SOR</mark>, then the more time-consuming valuation based on quantities of work done and MOS is still required with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no time saving</mark>
		- If the description of a stage is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">worded to be too restrictive or subjective</mark>, this may render no payment if there are minor incompleteness or minor defects or stringent acceptance attitude. The descriptions should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">written very carefully</mark> with room for approximation and tolerances. Criteria based on some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">objective benchmarks</mark> would be preferred.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Changes</mark>
		- Provisions should be included to describe <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">how to treat variations, provisional quantities and claims</mark>. Some variations may affect the completion of a stage and some may not. The stage payment schedule may be rendered impossible to implement if there are many variations affecting many stages. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">administrative time to make and agree the adjustments</mark> may outweigh the time to do a normal quantity-and-rate valuation. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the amounts of stage payments are not rigidly fixed but are flexibly linked to the estimated final contract sum, the task will be easier</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Differing features of activity schedule</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Mechanism</mark>
		- Similar to stage payment but the activity schedules are prepared by tenderers and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stages are in the form of activities usually with reference to their own programmes</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Basis of amounts payable</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No BQ or pro-forma SOR</mark> need to be provided to tenderers. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk of measurement errors are passed to Contractor</mark>. This will reduce the tender documentation time but will be more time consuming and costly for tenderers to prepare their tenders. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">long tendering period</mark> may be required. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of tendering will be reflected in tender prices</mark>.
		- Each lump sum price does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have to be derived from the usual SMM</mark> compliant quantity and all-in rate build-up but can be derived directly from the costs of labour, materials and plant and can be inclusive of all ancillary work and costs more relevant to each activity. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Varied quantities due to tenderers' own design</mark> can more easily be accommodated, and the design itself can become an activity
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Relevant to programme</mark>
		- Activities can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more closely related to the programme</mark> activities of the Contractor. Tenderers have to plan the works very carefully before preparing the activity schedule. This may help <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure that the tender is more comprehensive</mark> giving greater confidence in the tender prices
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Tender analysis</mark>
		- When the activity schedules are prepared by tenderers based on their own programme. It would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to appreciate</mark> whether the price against an activity is reasonable or not as the constituent sub-activities may vary. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pro-forma activity schedule may help</mark> to some extent. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A cap in the form of a percentage of the tender sum</mark> may be imposed upon some activities. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However, this may limit the flexibility</mark> which is the purpose of activity schedule.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If no breakdown</mark> of each lump sum price is required to be submitted by the tenderers, it would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to assess</mark> whether the quantities and rates are reasonable for the described activity, and there will be no rates for pricing variations. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A quantity and rate breakdown may be required</mark> to be submitted with the tender. A provision needs to be added to stipulate the implications of the quantities and rates <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for pricing variations</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Alternatively, a schedule of rates only</mark> may be required for pricing variations, but those rates may bear no relationship with those used in calculating in the lump sum price.
		- Given greater flexibility, tenderers may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">strategically re-allocate the prices to their advantage (e.g. front loading)</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Careful tender analysis</mark> should be conducted and any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">anomalies should be ironed out</mark>, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">some client organisations would not accept post tender adjustments</mark> to suit.
 
## Milestone Payment

- Concept
    - Works are broken into a number of specific activities with different cost centres, each with a value which will be included in payment valuation, when that specified activity is completed, the value of that portion will be paid
- Practice
    - Modification to SCC, SP required, define Milestone / Cost Centre / Milestone Schedule / Milestone Dates / Milestone Certificate
    - Tenderer to submit milestone payment schedule as required in COT
    - Payment schedule checked against BQ amount
    - BQ divided into Cost Centres
    - Variation
        - M/S schedule only change if VO to replace with new M/S or recalculation of %
- Application
    - ASD D&B, MTRC, civil engineering contract
- Advantages
    - Promote financial incentive to Contractor to achieve M/S
    - Greater commitment from Contractor towards time, more likely to completion on time
    - Relatively short time for QS to assess payment
    - More simplified interim payment application
    - Able to monitor progress simply by monitor cash flow
- Disadvantages
    - Substantial design and programme changes may render the original terms not workable; Activities can be concurrent
    - Payment mechanism less familiar by Contractor
    - Pre-qualification necessary to ensure Contractor's capability for this payment arrangement
    - More effort in tender preparation
    - Higher tender price since Contractor will allow more risk
    - No provision for MOS
    - Non-completion of non-critical works may affect payment and Contractor's cash flow
    - Contractor may focus more on achievement than quality
    - More efforts on Archi to determine achievement of M/S, might dispute
    - Rigid / loose definition of M/S may cause non-payment / over payment
    - Activities designed before tendering without Contractor's input might not be realistic
- Recommendation
    - Definitions of M/S should be realistic with margin or interpretation
    - Minimize post contract changes
    - State that in case the cumulative total of stage payments deviates from the value of actual workdone by a certain %, payment will be based on the latter
    - Minimize concurrent activities when devising payment terms
    - Re-agree M/S as appropriate

## Actual Cost / Target Cost

- Actual cost plus any agreed fee percentages
- Risk that actual cost could exceed the target cost
