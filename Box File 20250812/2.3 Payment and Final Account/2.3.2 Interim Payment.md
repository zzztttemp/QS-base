### Payment for Prelim (2024 D1Q2a)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Preliminary items</mark>
	- Preliminary items are usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">priced as many lump sums</mark>. It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common that the Contractors do not enter a price against every preliminary item</mark>, but only against some major or cost significant items
	- Tender Documents usually contain a clause stipulating that in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">absence of a price against any item, the price shall be deemed to be included elsewhere</mark> in the Tender Sum and hance the Contract Sum. This means that the valuations for payment can only be based on the prices expressly entered in BQ.
	- In any case, it is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's choice</mark> not to price against some items and price the total preliminaries low, which will result in lower amount of payment for the preliminaries. However, his rates for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">measured works should have become higher</mark> to gain the possible benefits of higher rates for variation additions which are more common than variation omissions
	- SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">32.2(3)(c)</mark> states that the payment valuations shall include "the proportion of the value of a preliminary item properly provided or carried out by the Contractor where its value is included as a separate sum in the Contract Bills". The key words are "proportion of the value included as a separate sum"
		- Bonus: it is customary to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">split each value into different proportions representing the initial setup costs, time related running costs, work value related running costs and final removal costs</mark>, and pay the value according to the proportions provided or carried out.
		- Bonus: larger proportion will be paid for preliminary items with high initial costs like premia for insurances and bonds, erection of hoardings, covered walkways and site office. However, plant and machinery will be paid proportional to their costs of use whether brought or rented. Other preliminary items without high initial costs will be paid proportionally to their overall item spent or values of the related measured work done, e.g. costs of site staff, temporary water or electricity, etc. , with a proportion retained to be paid later for the final removal of the physical items

### Payment for design submission *(2011 D2Q4A)*

- The valuation of IP should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">include the estimated value of work properly executed</mark>. This would not be restricted to work completely executed. Work <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">partially executed should be included</mark> in the valuation as well (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC 32.2</mark>). 
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design</mark> work of the glass canopy has been particularly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">described as part of MC's duty in the said BQ item</mark>. The unit rate for the said <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BQ item should be deem ed to have some allowance</mark> for the design work in the absence of other specific items for the design works.
- The value of design work done <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">should be included</mark> in the payment valuation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on a reasonable proportion</mark> of BQ rate to be worked out considering the relative costs of design, materials, labour and plant.
### Payment for design submission *(2024 D2Q2b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Design work for electrical installation works</mark>
	- By SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">32.2(3)(a)</mark>, the estimated amounts in Interim Certificate should include the estimated value of the permanent work properly carried out.
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design work is a part of the permanent work</mark> required to be carried out, and a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable proportion</mark> of the price for the permanent work for the design work done shall be reflected in the Interim Certificate, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">even when there is no separate design item</mark> in BQ.
	- If there is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separate item priced in the preliminaries</mark> or elsewhere for such design work, the value of design work done shall be paid proportionally to that price, with no duplication with the price for the permanent work.
	- Bonus: Although the Contractor has submitted the design, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prudent to check whether the Engineer</mark> has commented or rejected or approved the design. Based on the principle that only permanent work properly carried out shall be included in the Interim Certificate, discount factor shall be reasonably applied if Engineer has not yet approved the design.

### Payment for method statement for scaffolding *(2024 D2Q2c)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Method statement for scaffolding works</mark>
	- SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">32.3(3)(b)</mark> states that the payment valuations shall include "the proportion of the value of temporary works properly carried out where their value is included as a separate sum in the Contract Bills". 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Scaffolding works are temporary works</mark> which shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">paid if the value is included as a separate sum</mark> in the Contract Bills whether in the preliminaries or elsewhere.
	- Preparation and submission of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">method statement</mark> for the scaffolding works are parts of the scaffolding works and a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable proportion</mark> shall be included in the gross valuation to the extent of them being properly done.
	- However, if there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no separate item</mark> priced for scaffolding, it is presumed that the cost has been included in the unit rates for the relevant permanent work, e.g. cladding or tiling for which scaffolding is used. In this case, the value of scaffolding which is a piece of temporary works, shall not be valued in the Interim Payment, but shall be valued as part of the relevant permanent work <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in accordance with the work done progress of the permanent work</mark>.

### Payment of pro qty *(2024 D2Q2d)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Provisional quantities for rebar</mark>
	- All provisional quantities are subject to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remeasurement</mark> under the Contract, based on the latest drawings issued under instruction
	- The remeasurement of provisional quantities <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">takes time</mark>, especially for all reinforcement bars
	- It is common for the remeasurement of reinforcement to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">completed only at the later stage of the Contract</mark>
	- However, as stated above, the estimated amount in Interim Certificate should include the estimated values of the permanent work properly carried out under SFBC. These values shall be based on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual quantities</mark> done inclusive of variations <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether or not the contract quantities are firm or provisional, remeasured or not</mark>
	- If there are differences between the provisional quantities and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quantities measured or estimated from the latest instruction drawings</mark>, whether increase or decrease, the quantities so measured or estimated should be used in lieu of the provisional quantities when estimating the proportion of the actual quantities done on site and to be included in the payment valuations
	- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common for QS to allow for more in the provisional quantities</mark> and therefore make a discount when using the total value to value the work done, but the reasonableness of the discounted total should be demonstrated to the Contract by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sampled measurement of the steel ratios or progressive remeasurements</mark> before completed remeasurement
	- The total quantities of reinforcement <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bars delivered to site should serve as a good indication</mark> of the quantities fixed after subtracting the quantities not yet fixed, the quantities used for wastage, deemed to include spacers, and bards used elsewhere such as in temporary railing, rails, fencing, etc.

### Withhold more amount in low priced item *(2011 D2Q4B)*

- Where there are contract rates, the contract rates should be used of pricing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark> whether it is an addition or an omission, notwithstanding that the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">actual costs may be much higher or lower than the contract rates</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Similarly</mark>, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates should be used for payment valuation</mark>, even though it is obvious in the present case that the priced amount <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cannot reflect the actual cost</mark> of works, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unless there was a special agreement</mark> to deal with such unreasonably low rate at the time of tender clarification and contract award.
- If the Employer wants to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviate from the contract rates</mark>, MC may also explore opportunities to deviate from the contract rates, e.g. an item with highly priced rates have been omitted. This would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be desirable</mark>.
- BQ item for provision of O&M manuals has been <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">priced as included</mark>. Any monetary cost attributable to this item should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">be deemed to have been included for elsewhere</mark> in the rates for other items. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Unless there was a special arrangement</mark> to deal with such pricing at the time of tender clarification and contract award, in the case of omission of this item, there is no contract rate to use. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pro-rata rate</mark> making reference to similar items may be used. If there is no applicable pro-rata rate, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fair rate</mark> based on the reasonable cost to do it should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">be used for the omission</mark>. This reasonable cost may or may not be the same as HK$100,000 as suggested by Employer. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same principle applies to payment valuation</mark>.
- To <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">avoid the intentional insertion of low rates for these close-out items</mark> in anticipation of payment deduction, either the rates should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">carefully scrutinized at the time of tender award</mark> (Gov not allow adjustment) or the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">items are not to be priced separately</mark> such that the amount to be retained for work not yet done could be based on the more reasonable costs.

### Work done but drawing comment not addressed *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Work done but drawing comment not addressed</mark>
	- Architect should review <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether his comments were late</mark> for incorporation into the latest submitted shop drawings or late after the work had been done on site. If the work was done pursuant to the approved shop drawings current at the time, then subsequent changes should be regarded as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">VO</mark>.
	- Even if the approved shop drawings have not been strictly followed, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only the non-compliant portion</mark> should be excluded from the payment valuation. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect should advise on the nature and extent</mark> of non-compliance to enable a proper valuation. The estimated value of the exterior cladding is quite significant. A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduction from 90% to 50% without any justification is not fair</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Opening up for inspection</mark> is permissible under the Contract. If the opening up probes that the work done is not in compliance with the approved shop drawings, the cost of opening up and making good should be borne by the Contractor, otherwise the costs should be borne by Employer under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.8.2 of SFBC</mark>.

### VO not in payment application *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">VO not in payment application</mark>
	- Interim payment valuation should also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">include the value of variations</mark> properly done. The Contract does not have provision to limit the valuation to the items and amounts applied for by the Contractor.

### MC withhold NSC amount *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">MC withhold NSC amount, direct payment</mark>
	- Direct payment can be made to NSC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only if</mark> MC withholds certified payment without a good reason and without giving a prior notice to NSC. MC's failure should be ascertained and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">certified by Architect</mark> first before implementing direct payment. The direct payment is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at the Employer's discretion</mark> and for the withheld certified amount only. GCC authorizes wider discretion to cover future payments under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.8(3)</mark>

### Withhold for injury accident *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Withhold for injury accident</mark>
	- Architect's recommended sum is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more like a penalty</mark> to push the Contractor for a report on the accident. It does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not represent the value of work not properly done nor the loss and expense</mark> suffered by Employer due to the accident. There is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no specific price</mark> for the preparation of the accident report for deduction. Deduction of a notional sum without proven loss and expense is not permissible. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only possible deduction</mark> may be in respect of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prices for safety measures</mark> not properly implemented.

### One month late in programme, remind LAD *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">One month late in programme, remind LAD</mark>
	- There are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">still about 22 months</mark> until the contract completion date. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT is still to be considered</mark>. Employer has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not yet suffered any loss</mark> or expense due to the current delay. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD can only be applied</mark> after contract completion date as reasonably extended when the Contractor still fails to complete the works. The Employer is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not entitled</mark> to deduct any LAD now. While a declaration to reserve the Employer's right to deduct LAD is permissible, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">too premature</mark> to do so. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cl.24</mark>.

### MOS premature *(2019 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">MOS premature</mark>
	- The payment valuation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can exclude materials delivered to site prematurely</mark> under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.32.(2)(d)(ii)</mark>. It seems that the children play equipment was brought to site prematurely when there are still 8 months until installation. This may be an attempt to save Contractor's own costs only. In principle, no payment should be made now <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">until there are good reasons</mark> for early delivery for the benefit of the project, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">e.g. suiting seasonal production time, suiting bulk purchase in conjunction with Employer's other projects</mark>, etc. The Contractor should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">asked to clarify</mark>.

	- Under MC's request to include further value which had not been properly substantiated - confirm and state in writing
	- Reasonable ground for set-off, e.g. LAD
		- MC may challenge that Archi has not duly granted EOT
		- Must have settled EOT and issued non-completion cert
	- Archi withdraw the payment for good reason, e.g. serious error in the cert
	- Determination by Employer (cl.35.4(10))
- Consequence of non-payment
	- Breach of contract
	- Payment + interest (cl.32.13, NSC cl.33.13)
		- Simple interest instead of compound interest
	- Determination by Contractor / NSC (cl.36.1(1)(a), NSC cl.37.1(1)(c))
	- NSC: suspend the works (NSC cl.33.14)

### Employer's financial difficulty & non-payment *(2005 Q3.A)*

- Impact
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual effect</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Breach</mark> of contract conditions - payment should be made according to the certified amount by Architect within the period for honouring certificates
		- MC has the right to request payment by serving a notice of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determination</mark> giving 7 days for the Employer to honour such certificate. The contract can be determined if the Employer fails to pay for 14 days. MC is entitle to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E</mark> due to non-payment and determination
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Impact to project</mark>
		- Since MC has purchased material for the project and made other arrangement, determination of MC will involve <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruption period</mark> of approximately two months for performing survey with MC to document the status of completion as the basis of finalizing the account with MC
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Re-tendering</mark> of a partially completed project takes time and most likely will be more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costly</mark> than the original budget has allowed
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time lost from the determination</mark> of the Contract and resuming work with a replacement contractor will take at least approximately four months
		- A four month <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">acceleration</mark> in remaining 9 month project duration is practically <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to achieve if not prohibitively costly</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Practical effect</mark>
		- The four months of non-contraction period will lock up one third of the rooms and will incur <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operational inconvenience</mark>
		- Non-payment may trigger <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">strikes / protests by workers</mark> of sub-contractors of MC, causing disturbance to daily operation and damage to hotel's image 
		- Such funding shortage, if not handled and contained carefully could escalate spirally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">causing even more financial pressure upon the Employer</mark> on his business
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Impact to contractor</mark>
		- MC will be very skeptical and reluctant to input further resources into the project, unless his confidence can be restored with certain assurance / incentive. He will also face his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cash flow problem</mark> for payment of materials ordered and payrolls and payment to subcon
		- Apart from MC, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NSC</mark> will also need to be dealt with
- Solution
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Prerequisites</mark>
		- The issue of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unpaid amount need to be resolved</mark> with MC and NSC before alternatives can be arranged
		- MC should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be in favour of determining</mark> the main contract unless it is inevitable
		- MC has the right to exercise the contract provision. However, it may be convincing to MC to consider alternatives if he is given some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">assurance to future payments</mark>. Such assurance from Employer can be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in the form of a bond from sureties</mark> if the Employer can still arrange one
		- Employer may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">suspend</mark> the work by an issue of an AI postponing the execution of the works. This will allow the Employer additional period of time to resolve the funding issue. The suspension should not exceed 120 days, or the contract may be determined.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Alternatives</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Different payment terms</mark> than those in the contract, such as partial payment or delayed payment using the operating revenue from the hotel as a guarantee
		- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bank guarantee / bond</mark> can be used to restore confidence for continuing with the works, subject to Employer's financial arrangement with his financier
		- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">suspension period agreeable</mark> to both MC and the Employer during which MC will be paid for material ordered and delivered to site and be reimbursed his loss and damages until funding is resumed. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">An agreement to catch up</mark> with the programme once work is resumed should also be arranged.
		- 1 & 2 will cause least disruption to programme
		- 3 will create some disruption, extent depends on the duration of suspension. Associated <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E and acceleration cost</mark> shall be warned.

### Employer ask QS not to certify payment 

- Contractual duty of QS and Employer
- Consequence if not certify
	- Breach of contract & professional negligence
	- Late payment interest, determination under contract
	- Proceeding
- QS must act independently and impartiality 
	- Based on contract terms and facts instead of Employer's words
	- Refuse Employer politely and explain
	- "without prejudice to Employer's right under clause 40"

## Special Payment Arrangement

- Advance payment
	- Agreed amount paid by Employer to Contractor before work in done
	- Application
		- Gov project

		- Contracts which involve substantial up-front expenditure before materials are delivered to site
	- Practice
		- Advance payment amount & mechanism of set off stated in tender doc
		- Advance payment made up-front are recovered from subsequent payments 
			- Pro-rata basis to the progress value of work done
			- Faster recovery
				- Rate of recovery faster than progress of work by add a certain %
				- Recovery by instalments at specified number of IP
				- Recovery by instalments at IP issued after specified days
		- Might require Contractor to provide advance payment bond
	- Advantages
		- Improve Contractor's cash flow in early stage
		- Encourage early mobilization
		- Reduce risk of delay due to lack of funds
		- Attract more competitive tender prices if cash flow risk is lowered
	- Disadvantages
		- Risk of non-performance or contractor default after payment
		- Extra administration required for payment and set off
- Pay for safety
	- For gov project
	- Common items
		- Safety plan, safety officers, site safety committee, safety training, site safety audit performance, compliance to regulation related to site safety
- Stage payment
	- The Works are broken down into a number of stages of completion, each with a value which will be paid on completion of the relevant stage of the Works
	- Not at regular interval
	- Application
		- Lift installation, fitting out, minor contract, civil engineering contract
		- Contracts which can have easily defined stages of completion of the Works
		- Contracts of simple nature
		- Where Employer do not want to spend time / hire QS to value on regular basis
	- Advantages
		- Simple to operate if not much change from Employer
	- Disadvantages
		- Not suitable for complex projects with many design and programme changes
		- If the definition of stages are too loose
			- Contractor might take advantage to do work just enough to match the definitions while the value assigned is greater
			- Lead to overpayment and weaken Employer's control
		- If the definition of stages are too rigid
			- Literal interpretation of the definitions may result in non-achievement of the stages leading to argument
		- If the definition of stages are too complex requiring detailed calculations
			- Original intent to have a simple payment valuation method is defeated
		- The milestones are usually defined with reference to a programme planned before tendering, which may be unrealistic without Contractor's input
	- Solution to problems
		- Use realistic definitions for stages with margin for interpretation
		- Minimize concurrent activities
		- Minimize post contract changes
		- Include a condition that in case the cumulative total of stage payments deviates from the value based on work done and materials delivery by a certain percentage, the payment will be based on the latter
		- Re-agree the terms when necessary to represent the latest situation
- Time-related stage payment
	- Relate the milestone to a specific calendar day or a specific period after commencement
	- Application
		- Contracts which has strong emphasis on achievement in relation to time

### Bonus payment for early completion *(2013 D1Q2a)*

- The Employer is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">free to include a bonus clause</mark> in the Contract for early completion of the Works. The bonus scheme does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have to match the amount of LAD</mark>.
- Whether the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">early completion refers to the contract Date for Completion or extended Date for Completion</mark> would need careful consideration.
	- If the early completion refers to the contract Date for Completion only, it would mean that if the Substantial Completion is achieved before the extended Date for Completion but after the contract Date for Completion, no bonus will be awarded. This would mean that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a delay caused by Employer would reduce Contractor's opportunity to recap the bonus</mark>, and the Contractor would need to spend extra effort and costs to catch up more than the Employer's delay before he can reap the bonus. The Employer would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">benefit from his own fault</mark> first. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that this is unfair and would seek to refer to the extended Date for Completion as the benchmark for early completion. The special condition should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">elaborated further to expressly state the Employer's intention beyond doubt</mark>. However, the Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have real incentive</mark> to complete early once the Employer delays the Works.
	- If the early completion refers to the extended Date for Completion only, the SCC should be elaborated further to expressly state whether the bonus if <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on top of or inclusive of the loss and expense compensation</mark> for those EOT entitling financial compensation. 

### Advance payment not required in Contract *(2013 D2Q1)*

- By paying the deposit for kitchen cabinets, Employer will effectively be making an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">advance payment</mark> or over-payment to the Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without actual materials or work on site as security</mark>. It would expense the Employer to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher financial risk</mark> if the Contractor eventually does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not perform</mark>. However, if the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cash flow problem</mark> is real, without help, the chances of the Contractor not performing will be increased.
- Probably, the first thing to do is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">review whether there has been unreasonable shortfall in payment</mark> to the Contractor. Rectification of the shortfall may resolve the problem.
- If this is not enough, the likelihood of the Contractor eventually not performing will need to be <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">considered taking into account</mark> the following factors:
	- Whether the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">progress</mark> of the Contractor has been good
	- Whether the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">track record</mark> of good performance has been good
	- Whether the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financial difficulty is one-off or persisting</mark> showing signs of financial instability
	- Whether the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">forthcoming progress will be adequate to make up</mark> the temporary overpayment
	- Whether there is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bond</mark> given by Contractor and the bond is of adequate buffer to cover possible over-payment 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the Contractor is considered to be trustworthy</mark>, advance payment can be effected, possibly without going into the details of the payment arrangement between the Contractor and the kitchen cabinet people. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">method of recovering the advance payment in future needs to be agreed</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the sign of the Contractor not performing</mark> is very strong, perhaps <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tighter control</mark> will in fact be the only choice.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the financial difficulty is temporary</mark>, helping the Contractor will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">better to ensure the survival</mark> of him and the Contract, but some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">security measures may need</mark> to be considered.
- Possible <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">risk mitigation measures</mark> could be:
	- Requesting for an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increase in the level of bond</mark>, e.g. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increasing the existing</mark> bond amount, requiring an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advance payment bond</mark>, requiring a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">personal guarantee</mark>. However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">chances may be low</mark> because if the Contractor can arrange for any of these, he may not need to request for help.
	- Dealing <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">directly with the kitchen cabinet people</mark> by way of a direct contract but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not relieving the Contractor from his original responsibility</mark> due to such an arrangement - paying through the Contractor to kitchen cabinet people will not create any contractual obligation upon them towards the Employer. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">kitchen cabinet people may be required to give some undertaking</mark> towards the Employer in consideration of the indirect payment arrangement. However, in case of bankruptcy of the Contractor, it is doubtful whether the Employer can have any priority over other creditors in respect of such undertakings. Dealing directly with the kitchen cabinet people will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ensure</mark> that if the Contractor eventually does not perform, the kitchen cabinet people will still be responsible to the Employer, but may have a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">drawback</mark> that the Contractor may argue to be relieved over the future performance of the kitchen cabinet people.

### Deduct payment for unsatisfactory safety measures *(2015 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC do not have provision</mark> for deduction from Contractor's payment in respect of unsatisfactory site safety measures over the uncompleted value of site safety measures.
- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">government projects</mark>, the site safety measures have always been included as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">provisional items</mark> and the Contractor will get payment for those items if the Contractor did carry out or provide site safety measures according to the Contract requirements.
- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">private projects</mark>, similar provisional items may not be provided and the site safety measures would normally be included in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preliminaries</mark>. If the Contractor does not implement the site safety measures satisfactorily, the A / QS may take this into account in assessing the progress payment of the relevant preliminaries item in the valuation but may not deduct payment in the manner as requested by PM.

### Release Contractor's financial burden *(2020 D2Q3)*


- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Risk of granting assistance</mark>
	- There is a possibility of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overpayment</mark> if Contractor finally goes <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bankrupt or liquidated</mark> before completion of works
	- Financial assistance provided by Employer may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">used by Contractor on other projects</mark> instead of financing this project
	- Although Employer's financial assistance intends to improve the financial condition of Contractor, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to ensure</mark> such assistance to the Contractor can also be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">passed to all subcon or supplier</mark>, whose may also encounter financial difficulties
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Risk of not granting assistance</mark>
	- Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay or cut down payments</mark> to his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subcon, supplier, workers</mark>, or even his own staff who may subsequently slow down or suspend their works. Inevitably, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">progress of work will be adversely affected</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quality</mark> of works could also be affected as Contractor or subcon will reduce their resources deployed on the project due to financial difficulties or frustration of not being paid
	- Severe cashflow problem may cause quicker <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insolvency or liquidation</mark>
	- In both cases, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra time and costs will be incurred in procuring another contractor</mark> to complete the works, and the extra costs may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be fully covered by the surety bond</mark> available.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Interim cashflow relief measures</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Review whether there have been under valuation</mark> of work done, MOS, variations, pro qty and claims, and improve if found
	- Review whether the usual practice of paying time-related <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prelim</mark> prices as work-related has been adopted and adjust it to more closely reflect the actual cash flow pattern of Contractor. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Review</mark> whether the rather unusual practice of spreading insurance and bond premia over the contract period for payment has been adopted, and pay the premia as actually paid
	- Increase <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">frequency of payments</mark>, for example, instead of monthly payments, adopt biweekly payment to improve cashflow
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Shorten the time to value, certify</mark> and honour payments
	- Quickly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">assess variations, remeasure pro qty, and assess EOT and monetary claims</mark> not yet assessed to see whether there can be more money to be released
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Change monthly progress payment to pre-agreed milestone payment to reduce time of valuation</mark> and onward certification and honouring certificates. However, this may not be of immediate help
	- Make <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">direct payments for material off-site or on-site</mark> to the relevant subcon and supplier, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sign agreements to retain Employer's title</mark> to the properties, and to relieve Contractor's liability to pay them, but still <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">holding the Contractor liable for safety custody on site</mark>, keeping identification of ownership, and requiring the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procurement of insurances</mark> against loss of or damage to off-site materials. This will ensure the Employer can retain the ownership even when Contractor goes bankrupt. If Contractor can survive, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final account can make adjustment</mark> for the payment made by Employer
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Issue cheques through Contractor to subcon or workers in need but stating them as beneficiaries</mark>. Contractor has to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sign receipt of the payment as if actually paid to him</mark> under Contract, but he cannot pocket the cheque payment for his own use. This is different from direct payment for materials since no clear property title can be retained, and this keeps the privity of contract intact.
	- Make <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advance payment</mark> to Contractor to meet his own needs other than those satisfied by direct payment for materials or cheque payments to subcon or workers. There should be an agreement for the times and mode of recovery of the advance payments. This should be the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">last resort wince this would mean over-payment</mark>. All the preceding measures would not incur over-payment. Security such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advance payment bonds and personal guarantees</mark> from the Contractor's shareholders or senior management may be demanded from the Contractor, and are to be released when the advance payments are recovered. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Parent company guarantee or property mortgage is unlikely to be obtained</mark>.
