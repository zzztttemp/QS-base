### Valuation of delay recovery proposal *(2017 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Daytime working with no increase</mark> in the number of workers or plant should not be an extra
- For <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overtime work at higher pay, only the extra</mark> (i.e. after deduction of the normal payment with the same productivity) should be paid
- The rate for overtime pay is excessive because of possible confusion in counting the mandays. Using the light mast erector as an example, the numbers of the works (and MD) working normal hours and working overtime are the same. It means that the MD is actually a headcount instead if the equivalent mandays. Paying 1 MD to a worker working <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">1800-2200 for 4 hours</mark> gross already means more than double pay. The rate per MD should not be increased from $1400 to $2100.
- Provision of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">materials should not be an extra</mark> unless extra reserve has to be ordered
- Why are there <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more signalling workers working overtime than daytime</mark>?
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Only overtime pay</mark> should be treated as extras <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for supervisory personnel</mark> which are usually paid monthly salaries
- Should check <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the Contract already requires 24-hour security</mark> guard service
- There should be some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">savings in the payments to the supervisory personnel and security</mark> guards because of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduction of the construction period</mark>. This also applies to overheads. In other words, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolongation cost claim due to EOT should be waived</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Profit & overheads are admissible only if the other prices are costs without</mark> profit and overheads

## Acceleration Payment

- Head of claim
	- Extra cost for works at night / overtime
	- Loss of productivity in carry out works at night / overtime / in smaller areas
		- Lose advantage of economies of scales
	- Extra management and supervision cost
	- Productivity bonus
	- Extra materials and plant cost including transportation and storage
	- Extra temporary works for different construction method
	- Abortive works, doubling handling cost, special site arrangement
	- Extra acceleration cost for NSC / sub-con
	- Increase in ECI premium
	- Fluctuation adjustment
- Incentive bonus payment
	- Extra bonus if MC can achieve target completion date
	- May set interim milestones
	- If not achieve, revert to original contract terms

## Constructive Acceleration

- Concept
	- Failure by Employer / Archi to recognize that MC has encountered excusable delay entitled to EOT
	- Cause MC to accelerate to avoid LAD
- HK: usually no cost reimbursement 
	- US: failure or refusal to grant EOT is an implied instruction to constructively accelerate
	- Common law: should have some remedy, Employer benefit from his own breach
- Employer's ground
	- MC's own decision to increase resources
	- If confident to obtain EOT, best endeavor not acceleration, can recover prolongation 
- Conditions to claim constructive acceleration
	- Actual delay entitled to EOT by default of Employer
	- MC have given required notices
	- EOT is refused or not granted within the time stipulated in contract (60 days in cl.25.3(2)
	- MC inform the consequence of failure to grant EOT & measures to be taken
	- Actual loss / extra cost incurred and not recovered elsewhere
	- MC sufficient records and updated programme
