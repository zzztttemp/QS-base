## Concept

- Direct loss and expense (cl.1.6)
	- The monetary consequences that flow naturally without other intervening cause and independently of special circumstances because of the direct consequences of a qualifying event and which are not otherwise reimbursed to the Contractor
- Loss
	- Loss of what could have expected to under contract
- Expense
	- Increase of expected expenditure to produce same result
- Direct loss v Consequential loss
	- Direct loss (damages) flows naturally and directly
	- Consequential loss flows from the special circumstances
	- Remoteness rule
		- Hadley v Baxendale (1854)
			- " ... arising naturally according to the usual course of things ...  or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract ... "
- Global claim
	- Presenting a claim in which all causes of claim are lumped together and one overall damage given as consequence
	- Acceptable where it is impractical to separate the loss attributable to each head of claim
	- However, precedent condition cl 28.3 requires notice of claim
	- Court's ground in Bernhard's Rugby Landscapes v Stockley Park Consortium
		- Permissible where it is impractical to disentangle that part of loss attributable to each head of claim
		- And no contributory default
- Quantum meruit claim
	- "as must as is deserved"
	- Recovery for the value of work performed where no agreed-upon price exists or where a contract has been breached or is unenforceable
- Cost of preparing claim
	- Usually not recoverable 

## Legal concept of damages

- Compensatory damages
	- To compensate the claimant for loss under the contract
	- Entitlement consideration
		- Actual loss
		- Actionable
			- Financial loss
			- Consumer surplus if the contractual objective is to provide peace of mind
			- Distress
		- Caused by breach
			- Factual causation
				- But for test
			- Legal causation
				- Direct cause of the loss without subsequent event to break chain of causation
		- Reasonably foreseeable - remoteness rule
			- Arise naturally
			- Within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made
		- Whether the claimant mitigates the loss reasonably
		- Whether the claimant contributes the loss - contributory negligence
	- Loss assessment
		- Assess the loss at the date of breach
		- Aim is to put the innocent party in the position they woul dhave been in had the contract been performed as agreed
		- Measure
			- Expectation measure
				- Comparison between current position and the position would have been in had the contract been performed correctly
				- Only measure certain instead of discretionary / unclear
				- Method
					- Current & would have been
					- Cost of cure (rectify breach)
						- Unless innocent party not intend to 
						- Unless disproportionate 
			- Reliance measure
				- Put the claimant back in the position he was before the contract was made
	- Agreed liquidated damages
		- Genunine pre-estimate of loss
		- Payable irrespective of actual loss 34333333
- Non-compensatory damages
	- To compensate the claimant for loss under the contract & in relation to any bad conduct of the other party

## L&E Assessment

- Assessment assumption
	- Subject to proper substantiation from the Contractor and provided that the contract provisions in regard to notices of claims and conditions precedent to the Contractor's entitlement to direct loss and expense have been properly complied with
- Condition precedent
	- Qualifying event
	- Contractor not reimbursed by other provisions
	- Comply with cl. 28 procedure
- Consider Contractor's default (cl.27.3)
- Basis of assessment 
	- Period when the effect of delay occurs instead of overrun period at the end of the contract
	- To works affected not all of the works
- Relationship between EOT and L&E
	- L&E not necessarily EOT
		- Disruption & acceleration claim
	- EOT not necessarily L&E
		- Neutral events
		- Concurrent delay

### Wavier of L&E *(2020 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Purpose</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reduce the risk of budget overrun, enhance final cost certainty, and reduce time to resolve L&E claim</mark> by requiring Contractor to allow for or absorb the direct L&E so described in the clause
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Enforceability</mark>
	- The clause is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not prohibited by statutory laws</mark>. So long as the clause is agreed between the contract parties with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not duress or undue influence</mark>. It will be enforceable.
	- Bonus: whether the clause is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clear enough</mark> to achieve the intended purpose is anther matter
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT must be granted as usual</mark> for the clause to work
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Denominator</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">IP assessment whether put waiver period</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Normally, time-related preliminaries</mark> are required by special preliminaries clause to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valued as work-related</mark>. If they are permitted to be valued as time-related, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">denominator would normally be the contract period</mark>. This may mean that any allowance for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks would be paid earlier than the occurrence of the risks</mark>
		- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in the absence of the clause, Contractor would still have to allow</mark> for the L&E in respect of EOT without corresponding L&E compensation and in respect of his own delays, and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">IP valuation would not put his risk allowance in the denominator</mark>
		- After the occurrence of delays, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">denominator would normally be the realistic prolonged contract period</mark>. Payments for the risk allowance would be spread out.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">L&E assessment whether put waiver period</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E claims should in principle be valued based on the actual costs</mark> incurred or likely to be incurred irrespective of the preliminaries prices. Therefore, the risk allowance in the preliminaries prices would not matter. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if it is agreed that the preliminaries prices can be used for assessing L&E,</mark> whether the risk allowance should be considered in the denominator would need discussion. 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that 
			- Even though he was given the opportunity to allow for the risks, he has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not actually allowed</mark> any costs, and therefore, any increase of the denominator to include 90 days would be inappropriate
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Risk allowance is not in preliminaries</mark> but in the measured works. Once the measured works are done, they should be paid in full except for the retention percentage.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Concession during tender negotiation</mark>
		- If the clause is agreed as a concession during tender negotiation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">with no change to the tender sum</mark>, the Contractor will have a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stronger ground to say that he has actually not allowed</mark> any costs but would take the risk to absorb the costs.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Other L&E</mark>
		- Contractor's entitlement to L&E and that to EOT are governed by two separate contract clauses under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.26 & 25</mark>.
		- Under SFBC, some events are entitled to EOT only but no L&E. L&E clause covers not only prolongation but also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruption L&E.</mark>
		- There might be causes in which Contractor has incurred L&E due to disruption to an activity of works with no impact on completion date. Such <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cases would not have EOT</mark>, and L&E would not be precluded by waiver clause.
		- The Contractor may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">try not to claim EOT but claim disruption L&E to escape from waiver clause</mark>
		- Contractor may try to argue that L&E is partly related to prolongation and partly related to disruption. However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">words</mark> "any L&E incurred <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in respect of any matter</mark> for which the first 90 days of EOT" would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wide enough to cover any L&E</mark> in respect of that matter, and could therefore cover prolongation as well as disruption once that matter is entitled to EOT.
		- If the words are "any L&E incurred in respect of the first 90 days of EOT", then disruption L&E can escape from the waiver clause
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E beyond the first 90 days</mark> of EOT are not waived.
		- The clause does not exclude a claim for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common law damages</mark>
