- L&E due to disruption of works not on critical path (loss of productivity)

## Heads of Claim

### Additional Direct Costs (loss of productivity)

- Additional direct costs on labour, material and equipment
- EOT is not a condition precedent
- Loss of productivity in work
	- Compare productivity of undisrupted period with that of the disrupted period with similar works
	- Information for assessment
		- Direct labour allowed in tender
		- Labour resource or activity records on site
		- Records of labour output
- Inclusion
	- Standing time or idling of labour / plant resources
	- Demobilisation and re-mobilisation of labour and plant
	- Overtime working for labour / plant
	- Charge on early termination of hire of plant
	- Abortive works or materials (e.g. material deterioration & waste, additional delivery & handling cost, additional off-site storage, alteration to scaffolding)
	- Non-recoverable fluctuation
- Practice
	- Ensure no over-lap expenses claimed under other headings

### Justification for loss of productivity (2024 D2Q1c)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Justification for a claim for compensation for loss of productivity</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Loss of productivity</mark> is usually related to disruption and disturbance of the work activities and sequence. Without the disruption and disturbance, the work activities could have been proceeded as planned. With the disruption an disturbance, the amount of production of the originally assigned resources has decreased over the disrupted and disturbed period of time, thus <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">requiring extra resources</mark> during and after the disrupted and disturbed period of time, and possibly causing delay to the overall programme.
	- In order to demonstrate the loss of productivity, Contract shall carry out and submit a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruption analysis</mark> for the works carried out. The analysis should aim to identify the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changes in the resources and productivity over the relevant period</mark> of time to enable an understanding of the work activities involved and reasons for changes in the productivity. The Contractor should provide a set of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">endorsed and contemporaneous project records (e.g. site diary, labour records, manpower and resources plan, etc.)</mark> to substantiate the analysis
	- If the Contractor intends to claim the additional time and costs as a result of the loss of productivity, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">calculation of the extra time and costs</mark> involved together with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cause and effect explanation and supporting documents (e.g. labour, wages, labour records, etc.)</mark> should be provided.
	- The time and cost effects should be the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difference between the disrupted situation as compared with the situation if there had been no disruption</mark> and disturbance, which may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not necessarily be the same as the planned programme</mark> because the planned programme might not have been updated to reflect the latest situation before the disruption and disturbance
	- Instead of describing in general terms as the above, it is equally permissible for Candidates to give example illustration of items losing productivity, such as workers taking more rest times in a day, workers going to sheltered spaces, workers going more trips up and down the buildings, workers warming up after breaks, workers working overtime, workers needing time to take dinners because of overtime, productivity during overtime lowered, productivity working persistent long hours lowered even with more breaks, longer time to provide plant, additional refreshment and meal allowances (though not exactly a productivity issue by themselves), etc. In any case, it is important to demonstrate the extras over the situation in the absence of the disruption and/or disturbance.
	- Contractor owns the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">burden of proof</mark> on the loss of the productivity
	- Bonus: Candidates able to identify two <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">main families of disruption analysis</mark>, namely the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">productivity-based approach</mark> (e.g. measured mile analysis, project-comparison studies etc.) and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost-based approach</mark> (e.g. estimated and actual cost analysis, plant and labour analysis etc.)

		- Hiring cost / depreciation and maintenance
		- Long delay must be mitigated by using plant elsewhere or terminating hire contract
	- Temporary works (hoarding, scaffolding, etc.)
		- Maintenance cost
		- Identify works not affected by prolongation
	- Insurance and bond
		- Only if EOT granted & Contractor to maintain insurance
		- Based on actuak cost instead of proportionment
		- Calculation
			- Amount of insurance increase on both a time and value related basis
			- Subject to premium adjustment clause of insurance 
	- Adjustment of levies
		- If contract value increases, amount of levies increase
	- Other preliminaries items
		- Running cost portion of prelim
- Inflation on overheads
- Practice
	- Indirect cost is not payable
	- Inflation on Preliminaries
		- Usually disabled in private contract
	- Onus of proof in Contractor
	- Agree on approach, if not, actual cost approach
- Actual cost approach
	- Based on actual additional cost in Preliminaries
	- Pros
		- High accuracy
		- High flexibility to adapt to unique project conditions
	- Cons
		- Require comprehensive documents
		- More complex and time-consuming
		- High risk of dispute
- Value approach
	- Based on time-related Preliminaries in Contract Bill
	- Consider the proportion for establishment cost, running cost and clearing cost of Prelim items (or zero)
	- Pros
		- Less complexity and minimal documents required
		- Simpler and less time to calculate
	- Cons
		- May not reflect the true cost

### Head-office Overheads

- EOT is a condition precedent
- HO OH is in prelim & rate of measured works
- Inclusion
	- Purchase, rent, maintenance and running cost of head-office
	- Director, technical staff, administrative staff salaries and on-cost
	- Administrative expense, travelling expense
	- Legal, accountant and professional fee
	- Depreciation of the asset
- Inflation on overheads
	- If no inflation in Contract
	- Consolidated Labour and Materials Index
	- Index at the actual date of completion - average index of (tender date & original date of completion)
- Avoid double recovery
	- Mark-up and margin issue for OH %
	- Exclude additional HO OH recovered through VO 
		- May argue only VO causing prolongation should be considered
	- Exclude additional HO OH recovered through prelim in site overhead
- Actual cost approach
	- Basis
		- Based on additional cost actually incurred directly and indirectly arising from the delay, including resource continue to contribute to the project, and additional resource input
	- Difficult to identify and prove
	- Challenge by Employer
		- Still have to keep operation no matter prolongation or not
		- Even if fewer projects, mark-up percentage should not increase due to market competition
		- Unlikely to need additional resource due to prolongation
	- Assessment method
		- Compare timesheet of key staff for the delaying period & earlier stage of project, and allocate a proportion of other cost to the key staff
		- Global claim: claim total HO expenditure and deduct the total amount included in tender
- Lost opportunity approach
	- Basis
		- Contractor unable to take up further works because his resources are tied up to the project
	- Challenge by Employer
		- Must shown to have caused Contractor to decline to take on other works which were available
		- Must be no significant change in the market condition
			- Government Gazette indicating the level of construction activity 
		- Need check if Contractor is actively seeking extra work during the delay period
	- Assumption 
		- Existence of a favourable market where an adequate profit and fixed overhead percentage will be available to be earned during the delay period
	- Need to deduct HO O/H recovered from VO and elsewhere
		- Less HO O/H % x VO amount
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hudson's formula</mark>
		- = head office overhead % x contract sum (net) / contract period x period of delay
		- Head office overhead %: 3-7%
		- Contract sum (net) = original contract sum - preliminaries - PC sum / Pro sum / PC rate
		- Pros and cons: hard to prove the %
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Emden's formula</mark>
		- Same formula
		- Head office overhead % = total office overhead cost / total turnover of the company
		- All extracted from the contractor's year-end account
		- Pros and cons: use actual office overhead rather than an asserted one
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Eichleay's formula</mark>
		- = overhead allocated to the contract / contract period x period of delay
		- ![Pasted image 20250503163058|400](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250503163058.png)
	- Other
		- By examination of accounts over a three-year period: *J.F. Finnegan Ltd v Sheffield City Council (1998)*
- General for formula approach
	- Basis for HO OH *(2014 D2Q1)*
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Loss of opportunity</mark>
			- The Contractor has been prevented from earning further head office overheads due to his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inability to take up further works</mark> because his site resources are tied up by this project because of the delay. That is to day the Contractor has lost the opportunity to earn further head office overheads.
			- This might be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">challenged</mark> by requiring the Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prove</mark> that he did have the opportunity to secure further works and he did decline a real possible project.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">On-cost incurred</mark>
			- During the period of prolongation, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">head office services are continued</mark> to be required to support the project, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contribution</mark> towards the head office overheads would reasonably be required, without such contribution, the Contractor's business cannot sustain.
			- This might be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">challenged</mark> that the Contractor would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">still have to keep</mark> his head office operating no matter whether the project is prolonged or not, there should not be any loss or increased expense. It may further be challenged by saying that even if there are fewer project, the mark-up percentage would not be increased because of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">market competition</mark>. 
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Additional cost incurred</mark>
			- During the period of prolongation, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">additional</mark> head office staff and resources are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">employed</mark> to serve the project.
			- This might be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">challenged</mark> by a request to prove that additional head office staff and resources were employed because it would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unlikely to have that need</mark> due to prolongation.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Not recovered elsewhere</mark>
			- Head office overheads are usually priced based on a percentage mark-up on the costs of projects. That <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">percentage mark-up</mark> would be estimated based on the ratio of the yearly head office overheads to the yearly costs of projects. Therefore, time is a factor in the calculation. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Given a fixed amount of yearly head office overheads, decreased yearly costs of projects would increase the required mark-up percentage</mark>, if competitive market conditions can be ignored.
			- The use of formula purports to calculate the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">under-recovery</mark> of the head office overheads due to the prolongation by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">maintaining the same average level of mark-up percentage</mark> over the full period of construction.
	- Pros and cons
		- Simple and easy, save time
		- Not truly reflect actual loss and expense, involve many approximations and averaging
			- Reduce approximation by breaking into smaller parts
		- Mark-up percentage for a particular project may deviate from others
	- Calculation of HO OH % *(2014 D2Q1)*
		- Past 3-5 years audited account to iron out irregular fluctuation
			- The audited account of the years when the project are still running may be distorted by the effect of the project, but should still serve as a useful reference. If the purpose is not so much about the increase or decrease in the level of head office resources, but the general level to keep the company going, then this should not be a problem.
		- Check item by item appropriateness and relevance 
			- Include only regular long term running office OH
			- Exclude occasional or irregular expenses, e.g. purchase office / major equipment, excessive entertainment cost
			- Check if should be classified as HO OH, e.g. project staff at office serving more than one project
			- Take out overhead and project cost in relation to other non-construction business of Contractor
	- Use of full Contract Sum in formula "Contract Sum x (Period of Prolongation / Contract Period) x Head Office Overheads percentage" *(2014 D2Q1)*
		- Margin percentage or contract sum discounted to take out HO OH
		- PC / Pro sum should be taken out
	- Documentary proof
		- Records of tender invitations that the Contractor had declined during the period of delay; and that such work would have earned similar level of OH recovery
		- Proof supporting that the Contractor was prevented from taking further works, e.g. evidence of management meeting minutes, memos, internal directives and the like for turning down works.
		- Audited accounts
		- Detailed accounting records, only to be viewed at the Contractor's office to preserve business and staff's personal secretes
		- Detailed payroll records of expensive management staff and project staff stationing in the office and serving more than one project to ensure appropriate apportionment of the costs, only to be viewed at the Contractor's office to preserve business secretes

### Loss of Profit

- EOT or mission of works
- Omission of works
	- If genuine omission as work no longer required
		- No loss of profit
	- If work is required but omitted to be carried out by others
		- Loss of profit
- Claim under common law
	- Not likely to be granted - remoteness rule
	- Only if the Contractor can prove that there was other works available which, but for the delay, he would have secured
- Contractor's onerous to prove
	- Tender success ratio: all tenders submitted and awarded 
	- Decline in contracting opportunity: all projects invited to tender, which were declined or a deliberately high tender submitted
	- Average profit level: from audited corporate financial records
	- Casual link between the dispute and the decline in contracting opportunity
	- Loss of profit: average profit level x number of contracts lost due to dispute

#### Claim for loss of profit for less NSC award sum *(2018 D2Q4)*

- There has been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no guarantee</mark> that the awarded NSC sum must be very close to PC sum. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Usually state in Contract</mark> that no monetary claim for adjustment of PC sum
- PC sum serve as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">budgetary allowances and are usually set higher</mark>
- A 10% difference is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not abnormal</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">final NSC sum may become higher</mark> to narrow down the difference
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Some other NSC sum may be higher</mark> than PC sum to offset this particular difference

### Finance Charges

- Established in *F G Minter Ltd v Welsh Health Technical Services Organization (1980)*
	- Cash flow is vital for contractor
	- Not a claim for interest on debt due, but direct loss of interest resulting from the late payment
- Basis of financial charge
	- Cost of capital to finance the project
	- Interest on under-certification, remaining contract value, L&E, LD wrongly deducted
	- Interest on bond & retention
		- Might say already allowed in HO O/H
- Consideration
	- Interest rates shall be actual and realistic rates
	- Interest on alleged under-certification only allowed in situation of gross negligence
	- Finance charges in order to finance the project might be allowable if not covered elsewhere
	- Subject to proof of the actual costs incurred
- Calculated on compound basis (*Rees & Kirby v Swansea CC (1985)*)
- Calculated from the mid point of the extended period
	- Loss increased gradually with average at the mid point of the time extended
- Interest rate for late payment (cl. 32.13)
	- Interest at 1% below the judgment debt rate prescribed from time to time by the Rules of the High Court on the amount outstanding 7 days after the latest date on which the certified amount should have been paid 

### Constructive Acceleration w/o AI

- Comment to acceleration claim without AI
	- The fundamental <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">obligation of the Contractor</mark> under the Conditions of Contract is to work regularly and diligently throughout the Contract Period even though there are disruptions to their regular progress of works by Architect's instructions or otherwise which are responsible by the Employer. In the even of such disruptions and pursuant to the Contractor's claim and substantiation, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">EOT may be granted</mark> if the Architect considers same necessary.
	- The Contractor is also only required to work regularly and diligently in the extended contract period and in the period beyond the contract date for completion during which no further is being granted. Therefore, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the contractor's own initiative to carry out acceleration or mitigation measures may reflect that</mark>:-
		- The contractor have no confident in obtaining EOT under the contract or have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tried to catch up their own culpable delay</mark>, and therefore, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accelerate to minimize the LAD</mark> which may be deducted; and / or
		- The contractor may still target to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">achieve an early completion of the contract which entitled them to "bonus payment" </mark>under "bonus scheme" of this Contract
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Although the Contractor may</mark> have implemented acceleration measures, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">they would not be entitled</mark> to any payment nor compensation under the Contract <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">as no acceleration instructions have been given</mark> and unless early completion of the Works is achieved.
