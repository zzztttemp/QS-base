## Concept

- Insurance
    - An agreement where the insurer in return of a consideration (i.e. premium) undertakes to pay to the insured a sum of money or equivalent upon the happening of a specified event against the insured's financial interest
    - Transfer risk not liability
- Cover
    - Extent of protection offered by the insurer to the insured
- Limit of indemnity
    - Maximum amount of money that the insurer undertakes to compensate the insured
- Premium
    - The amount of money paid by the insured to the insurer as consideration in return for the insurer's undertaking of financial compensation
    - Factors
	    - Contract sum
	    - Excess
	    - Limit of indemnity (coverage)
	    - Contract period
	    - Nature of the projects
- Excess 垫底费
    - Insured shall pay first at his own expense before seeking compensation for any amount in excess
    - Purpose of limits
		- The levels of excesses can affect the premium to be charged
		- Specifying limits gives a common basis for pricing
		- Ensures that the levels of excesses are reasonable for the purpose
		- Excludes small claims
- Subrogation 代位求償權
	- Legal right of an insurance company to pursue a third party that caused an insurance loss to the insured
	- Common to waive rights of subrogation against co-insured parties in joint names 
- Cross liability clause
	- TPI & CAR
	- Insurance shall apply to each insured party as if a separate policy had been issued to each party and the insurance company waives all subrogation rights against any of the joint-insured.
- Escalation clause
	- Regularly review the total contract value upwards
	- To avoid under-insurance
- Excepted risk
    - Event beyond reasonable control of a party
    - SFBC (cl.1.6)
        - War, nuclear, pressure waves
        - Architect's design
        - Default by Architect, Employer
 
## Types of Insurance

- Employee's Compensation Insurance (ECI)
    - Against bodily injury or disease to employees arising out of and in the course of employment
    - Construction company: $200M regardless number of staff
- Third Party Liability Insurance (TPL)
    - Against personal injury & property damage
    - Subject to a maximum reimbursement per incident but unlimited in aggregate
- Contractors' All Risks Insurance (CAR)
	- Insurance which provides cover against physical loss of or damage to the Works, temporary works and materials and goods (cl.1.6)
    - Against contract works permanent or temporary
    - Parts of policy
	    - Schedules
	    - "All Risks" Clause
	    - General exceptions to the "All Risks" Cover
	    - Section 1: The Material Damage Clause
	    - Section 2: The Third Party Liability Clause
	    - General Conditions
	    - Endorsements / Special Conditions
- Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII)
    - Against liability for professional negligence
    - Common for D&B
    - Cover usually includes the exercise of reasonable skill and care but not the design fit for purpose
    - Reimbursement basis, only actual loss suffered by the professional can be recovered
- Difference in Conditions (DIC)
    - Where CAR by Employer and the coverage is narrower than the annual policy maintained by MC
    - MC can chose to cover the difference between CAR and annual policy by DIC
- Plant & Equipment Insurance
	- Not normally required, voluntarily purchased by the contractor

### Different period for CAR & TPI *(2014 D1Q4)*

- Upon SC, Contractor is obliged to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hand over</mark> the Works to Employer. Once handed over, the Contractor's responsibility for the care of the Works ceases. There will be no insurable interest for the Contractor to take out an insurance for the Works after handover. Therefore, CAR after SC should only last for a short period of 14 days.
- Employer should take out a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Property Liability insurance</mark> upon taking over the property from the Contractor.
- After SC, the Contractor would still need to carry out <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defects rectification</mark> works or outstanding works during DLP and such activities may have the risk of causing third party property loss or damage or personal death or injury. Therefore, the Third Party Liability Insurance would need to be continued to cover the entire DLP.
- Other: care of works, extra allowance in tender

### CAR for works outside site boundary *(2022 D1Q3b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">CAR for works outside the Site</mark>
	- Under the Contract, it is the Contractor's responsibility for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">care of the whole works</mark>, except for loss or damage arising from Excepted Risks
	- The works to be carried out <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">outside the site are also part of the works</mark>
	- Contractor who is obliged to effect and maintain <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CAR</mark> shall ensure the insurance policy covers the whole works, whether they are carried out within or outside the site
	- However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance policy usually defined the site</mark> and the insured works as being those on the site. Therefore, it is important that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">suitable descriptions or endorsement be included to cover works outside the site</mark>

### Insurance after SC for defects & enhancement works *(2011 D2Q1)*

- Desirability
	- Usually, a construction contract would require insurance of the Works, third party liability insurance and employees' compensation insurance. The taking out of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ECI is a statutory requirement</mark>, while the taking out of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the other two is only a contractual requirement</mark> either to be responsible by MC or Employer. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC's liability for the care of the Works and towards employees and third party would not be changed in the absence of insurance</mark>. If MC qualifies to exclude the taking out of insurances, it should be clarified if the liability would remain the same. 
- Applicability
	- Usually a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CAR would be taken out to cover insurance of the works and third party liability</mark>. The insurance would provide cover for the period of insurance <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">from commencement to end of defects liability period</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">except</mark> that that the material damage section of the policy would typically say that the insurance would not cover the part of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Works taken into use by the Employer unless the loss is occasioned during DLP and caused by an occurrence before completion</mark>.
- Building management
	- Under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Building Management Ordinance</mark>, the corporation of a building shall take out a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">third party liability insurance</mark> for the common parts of the building, and may take out <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">property insurance</mark> for the common parts of the building. For buildings without corporations, it is prudent to have such insurances. The third party liability insurance may provide <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cover for liability arising from minor repair and maintenance works</mark>.
- Arrangement
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Insurance of the building</mark>
		- The building, being "the Works" under the present Contract, is no longer covered by the works insurance
		- It should be covered by a new <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">property insurance</mark> effected by Employer after Substantial Completion
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Insurance of the Works</mark>
		- The defects rectification works, being the residual part of the Works, would be covered by the typical insurance policy wordings. (maybe...)
		- Enhancement works are not the works under present Contract, and would need to be insured. 
			- The current policy may be specifically endorsed to cover.
			- The new property insurance of the building may be extended to provide the cover. 
			- However, it would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cheaper to effect a separate insurance</mark> either by E / MC rather than adjusting the bigger insurance
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">TPI</mark>
		- Defect rectification works covered by the insurance under present Contract
		- Enhancement works not covered by the insurance under present Contract
			- The current policy may be specifically endorsed to cover
			- The new TPI of the building may be able to cover id the value of enhancement works is smaller than the value of maintenance works in the policy.
			- However, it would be cheaper to effect a separate insurance either by MC / E rather than adjusting the bigger insurance
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ECI</mark>
		- Defect rectification works covered by the insurance under present Contract
		- Enhancement works to be covered by a new insurance policy. In view of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">statutory obligation</mark> and the small value involved, it should be effected by MC, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unless there is already a master policy effected by Employer.</mark>
	- SFBC 2005/6
		- ECI / TPl: commencement until Defects Rectification Certificate
		- Insurance of the Works: commence until 14 days after Substantial Completion

### MC's action after DSC damage utility cable

- Keep <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">record of this incidence</mark>, including taking photo etc immediately
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Notify other parties, such as architect, utility company and insurance company</mark>
- Check the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">source of error</mark> resulting in footing protrusion and cable damage by investigating: -
	- Whether information of the cable is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shown on drawings</mark>?
	- If shown, whether the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">location of the cable is correctly indicated</mark>?
	- Whether information regarding the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">setting out of the footing is correctly shown</mark>?
	- If there an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obligation</mark> for MC to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">check accuracy of drawings</mark>?
	- Has MC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">discharged his duties</mark>?
	- Does the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DSC have the responsibility / obligation</mark> to check the same?
- Consider the<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> rights and liabilities of the various parties</mark>, such as
	- Can MC withhold payment and / or set off <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">against DSC </mark>(if it is the DSC responsibility)?
	- Can MC claim <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">against client</mark> (if the drawings contain error)?

### Fire cause damage *(2013 D2Q2)*

- A (Contractor's reason), B (Employer's reason), C (neutral event)
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost of restoring the damage</mark>
	- By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 2.1(1)(h)</mark>, the Contractor shall take <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility for the care of the Works except for L&E arising from the excepted risks</mark>. This appears to cover Scenarios A and C and only excludes Scenario B from the Contractor's liability.
	- By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 22.6</mark>, the Contractor shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be entitled to any payment in respect of the restoration of the damage other than the insurance compensation</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unless</mark> the loss or damage was caused or contributed to by a breach of contract or other <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">default by the Employer</mark> or any person for whom the Employer is responsible. This latter part only excludes Scenario B from the Contractor's liability.
	- By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 22.7</mark>, the effecting of the insurance is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without prejudice to clause 2.1.</mark>
	- Three clauses combined would still mean that the Contractor is liable under Scenarios A & C.
	- A possible argument would be by way of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 20(b)</mark>, where the Contractor shall be liable for injury or damage to real or personal property to the extent that the injury or damage is due to a breach of contract or other default of the Contractor or any person for whom the Contractor is responsible. This clause does not exclude "the Works". If this clause is interpreted a a qualification of clause 2.1(1)(h), then Contractor would be liable under Scenario A only. If this clause is interpreted as a supplement to clause 2.1(1)(h), then the Contractor would still be liable under Scenarios A & C. 
	- It is an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implied term</mark> of contract that a contractor undertaking to carry out and complete the Works must make good any damage to the Works occurring before completion unless the damage is so great leading to frustration or the damage was caused by the Employer's default
	- In the absence of express provisions contrary to the implied term, it would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable to take clause 2.1(1)(h) as the overriding clause not affected by clause 20(b)</mark>.
	- The above would mean that
		- Scenario A&C: borne by Contractor unless compensated by insurance
		- Scenario B: falls into the scope of excepted risks or clause 22.6. Borne by Employer only to the extent beyond the scope of insurance. Contractor is responsible to Employer for Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">failure to insure</mark>.
