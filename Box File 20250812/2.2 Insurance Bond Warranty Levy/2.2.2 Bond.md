### Reason for default bond and adequacy of % (1999 Q 3)

- Reasons for not specifying an on-demand performance bond
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not a normal practice</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Not procurable by those contractors who have low level of cash</mark> or bank credit - these contractor may need to deposit an amount equal to the amount of the on-demand performance bond with the bank as security
	- High <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk</mark> to contracts with resultant <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher tender prices</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Less competitive tenders because of fewer number</mark> of financially capable tenderers and higher tender prices
- Argument as to adequacy of 5%
	- Whether 5% is adequate<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> depends on the time of the contract when the default in question occurs</mark>
	- It may not be adequate at certain times, say <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">when a lot of items of work are only partially constructed</mark>
	- 5% is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">industry standard</mark> which should provide some (though may not be all) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">degree of protection, without losing competitive tenders</mark>
	- A higher percentage may be specified but it will attract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher tender prices</mark>
	- A 100% coverage will greatly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">decrease the number</mark> of willing and able tenderers

### No specific calendar date for bond expiry

- Reasons that a specific calendar date for the expiry of a performance bond is not acceptable
	- In case of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delayed completion</mark>, a bond with a specific calendar date for expiry has to be extended when the expiry date is near. However the<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> surety may refuse the extension if at that time he finds that the risk of the contractor being not able to complete the Works is high</mark>. The Employer will then lose his protection. Therefore the expiry date must be a floating date until Practical Completion thus <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">allowing for delays.</mark>
	- The candidate is expected to explain why on the one hand a bond with fixed expiry date is not acceptable and on the other hand a compromise solution is to be considered:
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Banks</mark> obviously would not like a floating expiry date and would try to use a specific calendar date. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Small contractors having lesser financial standing would have less bargaining power</mark> and would have real difficulties in obtaining a bond with a floating expiry date.
- Compromise solution
	- Considering Surety may refuse to issue a bond with floating expiry date
	- A compromise solution with modified terms of bond would be to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specify a much later calendar date for expiry with reasonably adequate allowance for delay</mark>, say original contract completion +6 or 12 months. 

## Enforcement of Bond

- Money held by client shall be used to mitigate his loss before calling bond
- Time to call bond is irrelevant as long as the non-performance was before SC
- Difficulties in performance bond
	- Surety may not accept that there has been a default on Contractor, and raise defence and cross claims
	- Some forms of bond has early release provision, call must be made before expiry
	- Some forms of bond has condition precedent to the Employer's right to recovery, e.g. notification in writing, obtain judgment or arbitration award
	- Form of demand shall follow requirements
	- Most forms of bond need an account after completion contract, which prevent Employer from immediate recovery of damages
- Enforcement of on-demand bond
	- The call must be worded to conform with requirements of the bond
	- No fraud or dishonest 
		- Fraud if the beneficiary knows that there is no right to payment

## Alternative to Bond

- Adjustment to retention %
- Adjustment to period of retention release
- Request cash deposit / amount payable withheld as security
- Parent company guarantee / personal guarantee
- Letter of credit
