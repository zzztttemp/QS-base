## Type of Delay

- Delay by Contractor's default: LD
- Delay by Employer or the project team: EOT, L&E
- Delay by natural event: EOT
 
## Concurrent Delay

- Concept
    - Concurrent delay
	    - More than one independent events impact the progress in similar time periods
	    - Both events lie on critical path and affect completion
	    - Either will cause delay if they happened on their own
	- Type of delay
        - Excusable delay: entitled to EOT
        - Culpable delay: Contractor's default
        - Compensable delay: entitled to EOT & LAD
- Pre-condition
    - True concurrent delay
    - At least one event is entitled to EOT
    - Affect critical path and completion date
    - Each event will cause delay if they happened on its own - independent delaying effect
- Assessment approach
    - Dominant cause approach
        - Dominate cause take precedence
	        - Ruling, prevailing and most influential
	        - E.g. involve a greater area of the project
	        - E.g. begin earlier and end later
        - Determining dominance
            - A question of fact, not solved by mere point of order in time (sequence of events)
            - Common sense standards
            - Review criticality and efficacy
        - Delay reason more than one head, EOT under both heads, not dominant reason only
        - H. Fairweather and Co Ltd v London Borough of Wandswoth (1987)
	        - Strike for 81 weeks & late instruction
	- First past the post approach
		- The cause of delay which occurs first will be used for adjustment of the contract period
		- Other cause of delay will be ignored unless thy affect the completion date and continue on after the first cause ceased
    - Tortious solution (tort law)
        - Breach of duty of care in tort of negligence
        - Recovery of economic loss if the loss is reasonably foreseeable and not too remote
    - Apportionment approach (outdated)
	    - Delay apportioned between parties on a fair and reasonable basis
		    - City Inn v Shepherd Construction (2007)
    - Devlin approach
        - If both of approximately equal efficacy, the breach alone may be sufficient to recover loss
        - Full EOT if concurrent delay
            - Henry Boot v Malmaison Hotel (1999)
        - Employer may amend in SCC to disable EOT if concurrent delay
            - North Midland Building Ltd v Cyden Homes Ltd (2017)

## Concurrent Delay Scenarios

- Subject to pre-condition
	- NOD, NOC
	- Critical path
	- Actual delay & knock-on effect
	- Listed event / qualifying event
	- Contractor's best endeavours to prevent delay

### N + E

- But for E's delay, still N delay
	- EOT
	- L&E for E's portion 
		- Contract provision, no mention consider N delay
		- E cannot take advantage of N delay, benefit from own prevention
	- Argument
		- No E's delay, still N delay

### N + C

- But for N initial delay, no subsequent C's delay
	- EOT
	- N initial delay is the cause
- But for N delay, still C's delay
	- Effect of N delay if no C's delay
	- C cannot take advantage of N delay, benefit from own prevention

### E + N

- But for E's initial delay, no subsequent N delay
	- EOT, L&E
	- E's initial delay is the cause
- But for E's delay, still N delay
	- EOT
	- L&E for E's portion 
		- Contract provision, no mention consider N delay
	- Argument
		- No E's delay, still N delay
		- No causal link
#### Late instruction cause wet season *(2009 D2Q2A)*

- The delay to commencement of site formation works during the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">initial 60 days</mark> was due to an event for which the Employer / Architect is responsible, i.e. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late issuance of design information</mark>
- The period of initial delay had a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">knock-on effect</mark> on the timing of the site formation works, which had to be carried out during a period of adverse weather instead of during the dry season as originally programmed by Contractor.
- It is not unreasonably for the parties to have assumed and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contemplated</mark> that the site formation works, being a critical activity of the works, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">would be affected by adverse weather</mark> as the works were to be carried out in the open. Any delay caused to the completion of the site formation works would have a direct impact on the completion of the whole of the works.
- On this premise, it could be said that the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">cause</mark> of delay <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">flows directly from the initial delay</mark> for which the Employer is responsible. Hence the causative event of the subsequent 30 days delay was neither due to the adverse weather nor its subsequent effect, but due to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preceding period of delay for which the Employer was responsible</mark>.
- The Architect granted the subsequent 30 days of EOT for completion of the works thus recognizing that the delay caused by the adverse weather condition was also on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path.</mark>
- Hence, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">subject to proper substantiation from the Contractor and provided that the contract provisions in regard to notices of claims and conditions precedent to the Contractor's entitlement to direct loss and expense have been properly complied with</mark>, the Contractor should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">entitled</mark> to be reimbursed for any direct loss and expense proved to have been incurred during the subsequent 30 days delay caused by the adverse weather <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">and its subsequent effect</mark> under cl.27.1(g)(l).


### C + N

- But for C's initial delay, no subsequent N delay
	- LAD
	- C's initial delay is the cause
- But for C's delay, still N delay
	- EOT
	- Contract provision not mention concurrent delay no EOT
	- Consider contractor's default involved in delay (cl.25.4) - support EOT for concurrent delay 
	- Contractor may catch up delay

### E + C / C + E

- Net effect of E 
	- EOT - full period - Henry Boot case
	- L&E - dominant effect (start early / last longer)
	- Employer is obliged to afford agreed time to Contractor to carry out the works
	- C's delay is immaterial
	- Contract provision not mention concurrent delay no EOT / L&E
	- Consider contractor's default involved in delay (cl.25.4) - support EOT for concurrent delay 
	- E cannot take advantage of C's delay, benefit from own prevention
	- Employer shall compensate by granting EOT if disruption
	- Contractor may catch up delay
- Argument
	- C already delayed and incurred L&E

#### Concurrent delay claim (2018 D2Q2)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">EOT for overlapping delays</mark>
	- Concurrent delay has very special and strict meaning as decided by court cases, but there is no need to dwell into the detail for the purpose of this question. Overlapping delays is used here to avoid going into that complication
	- Employer's delay here means a delay entitling Contractor to EOT 
	- Contractor's delay here means a delay not entitling Contractor to EOT
	- Subject to the contract provisions, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">general principle of law</mark> is that Employer is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obliged to afford the agreed time</mark> to Contractor to carry out the works. If during the course of the works, the remaining time afforded for carrying out the balance of the works is reduced due to an Employer's delay, the Employer shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">compensate</mark> the time so reduced by granting an EOT of equal magnitude. Whether the remaining time is already not achievable due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's delays is immaterial</mark>. The foregoing is an example of the application of the principle that the Employer shall not prevent Contractor from carrying out the works, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer shall not benefit from his own prevention</mark>.
	- If the work affected by the late provision of information lies on the critical path to the completion of the works, the late provision will reduce the remaining time afforded for carrying out the balance of the works and should entitle the Contractor to EOT
	- Bonus: recent <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">case in UK</mark> decided that if it is expressly agreed in the Contract beyond doubt that the Contractor will not be entitled to EOT due to Employer's delay overlapping Contractor's delay, the contract agreement will be upheld. The standard forms of contract to be used for these Practice Problems do not contain such provisions
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC provision</mark>
		- Employer's delay is called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">listed event</mark>
		- Late provision of information is a listed event pursuant to clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(3)(1)</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.3(1) subject to other provisions on notice requirements</mark>
		- There is no provision in the Conditions of Contract inconsistent with the general principle stated above. In face, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 25.3(6)</mark> dealing with delays after the extended Completion Date gives <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">support that EOT should still be granted</mark> for Employer's delay occurring during a period of Contractor's delay
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Monetary claims for overlapping delays</mark>
	- For the purpose of this question, compensable event is used to mean a delaying event for which the Contractor is entitled to loss and expense compensation under the Contract
	- There is a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">school of thought</mark> that if a compensable event occurs during the period of Contractor's delay, since the Contractor would have incurred the loss and expense anyway, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">compensable delay would not cause additional loss and expense</mark> to the Contractor and the Employer would not need to compensate the loss and expense.
	- The period of Contractor's delay occurring before compensable event is not caused by the Employer and should therefore not be the Employer's concern. However, when the compensable event starts to occur, there can be rooms for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">counter-arguments</mark> to the above school of thought.
	- An argument would be that if a view is taken prospectively at the time of the start of the compensable event, EOT would need to be granted for the compensable event, which invariably is also an Employer's delay. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">period of extension would cause loss and expense to the Contractor</mark> and the Contractor should be compensated. During the period until the end of the extended period, the Contractor is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">free to work at his own pace</mark>. Any slow progress during this period should not affect the compensation. 
	- Another argument is that after the start of the compensable event, its <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">impact is more dominant</mark> than that of the Contractor's delay, e.g. lasting for a longer time. Loss and expense should be compensated for the dominant delay.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC provision</mark>
		- Compensable event is called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">qualifying event</mark>
		- Late provision of information is a qualifying event pursuant to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(g)</mark> subject to other provisions on notice requirements
		- It may be noted, however, that clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">27.3</mark> requires that when a qualifying event is partly contributed to or aggravated by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's default</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sufficiency of Contractor's particulars of claim</mark>
	- For EOT, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.2</mark> requires the Contractor to submit full particulars with his second notice of EOT claim, and the Architect is obliged to consider EOT entitlement after receipt of the second notice. However, there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no provision stating</mark> that the submission of the full particular must be a condition precedent to considering EOT. In fact, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 25.3(4), (7), (8)</mark> permit the Architect to take the initiative to review previous EOT to the extent that he is able to do so based on information available or so far as fair and reasonable.
	- For L&E, according to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 28.3</mark>, submission of full particulars is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">condition precedent</mark> to entitlement. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However, it would appear that if some particulars are sufficient to justify part of a claim, it would be unreasonable not to consider</mark> that part of the claim to the extent justifiable.

#### Late instruction then strike, but already delay by C *(2011 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7.2.3. Late instruction then strike, but already under delay</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Listed event and consequence</mark>
		- Provision of late information is a ground of EOT under cl.25.1(3)(l) and L&E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(g) provided a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Notice of Claim</mark> has been made beforehand under cl.28.
		- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">strike off-site affecting the delivery of materials is not a ground for EOT</mark>. However, if the strike <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">could have been avoided</mark> has the provision of information not been late, then the effect of the strike should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">taken into consideration</mark> if provision of late information is established.
	- MC is obliged to complete the Works by the original or extended date for completion. The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Employer should not hinder MC from catching up his own delay</mark>.
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">latest time to provide the information should be worked back</mark> from the earliest time that the MC could possibly start the tiling work, allowing reasonable time for ordering and delivery.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If</mark> the anticipated period of delay of 30 days was a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">realistic estimate</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">and could not possibly be caught up completely by MC</mark>, then the apparent 2 days' delay as compared to "MP-01" should not be considered as late, and the whole of 2 + 6 days would not qualify for EOT consideration.
	- Furthermore, whether the tiling work is on the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">critical path</mark>, should also be considered.
		- The relevance of master programme "MP-02" should be critically viewed because it was updated later than the delaying event and might have reflected the delay already.
	- In summary, the delay of 2 days would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not appear to have a critical effect</mark> on the MC's best possible programme to achieve the original or extended Date for Completion, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no EOT</mark> should be granted.

## Single Cause of Delay Scenarios

### Inaccurate Site Investigation Report Cause Delay (2001 Q 4.1)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Letter as Contractor QS</mark>
	- Whether the accuracy of the site investigation report can be completely denied by the Employer is not a legally settled question
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inadequate time or impossibility</mark> such as demolition in progress during tendering to verify the accuracy of the site investigation
	- Site investigation reports from adjoining areas indicated that the Architect's site investigation report was consistent with them
	- Even though its applicability over the whole site is not guaranteed, the Architect's site investigation report must bear a reasonable degree of accuracy in respect of those <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">locations investigated</mark>
	- It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable for the Contractor to reply</mark> upon the Architect's site investigation report
	- Subsequent boreholes show that the Architect's site investigation report was not accurate even for those locations investigated
	- The Architect's site investigation report amounts to a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">misrepresentation</mark>
	- The BA's requirement to review its previous approval is too stringent. The Architect has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not exercised due diligence to argue with the BA to waive</mark> this requirement
	- The Contractor has done proper procedures after contract award. The present requirements for re-approval by BA <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">could not be within the contemplatio</mark>n of the Contractor at the time of tendering and could not have been allowed for in the Contract in terms of time or costs 
	- Other contractors appointed to do the job would face the same problem
	- Suggest to grant <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT with LD and prolongation costs waived</mark> by both parties

### Protest cause delay *(2011 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7.2.1. Protest</mark>
	- Firstly it should be checked <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">whether the protest</mark> against "damage of the environment due to construction" was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">due to any improper construction activities by MC</mark>. If yes, MC should be responsible. If no, the reason could be due to the development of the project by Employer.
	- Obviously, the Employer would not have called upon the protesters, and he should therefore not be held liable for this.
	- However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if the protesters' action was incited by Employer</mark>, whether the Employer can be free of liability is doubtful.
	- As an argument for granting EOT, this may be treated as civil commotion which is an excepted risk under cl.1 and granted with EOT under cl.25.1(3)(d), but no L&E under cl.27.
	- As an argument against granting EOT, it is doubtful whether the scale of this amounts to civil commotion, which should affect the society at large.
	- Equitably, EOT without L&E entitlement should be granted.

### Black rain & consequence cause delay *(2011 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7.2.2. Black rain & consequence</mark>
	- EOT is authorized under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(c)</mark>. However it does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not mention the consequential effects</mark>. While on one hand, consideration should be given to the full effects of the event, i.e. including consequential effects, on the other hand, by contrasting with cl.25.1(3)(b) which specifically mentions "consequences", it may be argued that consequential effects are excluded.
	- The extra two days for pumping work can only be considered under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(b) as the consequences</mark> of inclement weather provided that the conditions of inclement weather is fulfilled.
	- The above is based on the assumption that the Contractor had provide <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable protection, and done his best endeavour to mitigate</mark> the consequence of black rainstorm.
	- No L&E entitlement under cl.27.

### Black rain & consequential flood cause delay *(2024 D2Q1a)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Black Rainstorm Warning</mark>
	- The hoisting of tropical cyclone warning signal No.8 or above or the announcement of a Black Rainstorm Warning is a listed event with EOT entitlement under clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(3)(c)</mark>.
	- In general, the full direct effect of the listed events should be considered when granting EOT. However, in the present case, clause 25.1(3)(c) uses the words <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"hoisting ... Signal" and "announcement of ... Warning" instead of "No.8 tropical cyclone" or "Black Rainstorm"</mark>. Those words would restrict the times of applications. Furthermore, clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(3)(b)</mark> permitting inclement weather conditions as a listed event has the phrase "and/or its <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">consequence</mark> adversely affecting the progress of the Works." By comparison, while (b) permits the aftereffects, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">(c) does not permit similarly</mark> but restricts to the time of hoisting and announcement. Therefore, it is reasonable not to grant EOT for the 5 days after 7 September 2023.
	- However, the Contractor may consider to use clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(3)(b)</mark>, which permits EOT for delays caused by "inclement weather conditions, being rainfall in excess of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">twenty millimetres</mark> in a twenty-four-hour period (midnight to midnight) ..., <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">and its consequences</mark> adversely affecting the progress of the Works", because the Black Rainstorm should likely have caused the required amount of rainfall. Nevertheless, the Contractor should demonstrate how the Works were delayed to what extent by what kind of consequence effects.
	- Bonus: Contractor may consider to use clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(3)(e)</mark>, which permits EOT for delays caused by "loss or damage caused by a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Specified Peril</mark>". According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 1</mark> interpretation and definitions, "flood" is one of the Specified Perils. It should be noted that when the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">scopes of two listed event descriptions overlap</mark>, an event listed in the specified one should be deemed excluded from the other more general one. For example, a Black Rainstorm can no longer be treated as a force majeure or a special circumstance also entitling to EOT. However, "flood" can narrowly escape that argument.

### Imposing new Lands Dept Guidance Notes (2024 D2Q1b)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Guidance Notes by Labour Department</mark>
	- The guidance notes are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not mandatory statutory obligation but are guidance</mark> for discretionary use.
	- The Contractor was specifically instructed by Architect to comply with the Guidance Notes. If the compliance has resulted in any changes falling within the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">definition of Variation under clause 1.6</mark>, he is entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT under clause 25.1(3)(h)</mark> for delay caused by "an AI under clause 13.1 requiring a Variation"
	- The definition of Variation includes "..., the imposition of an obligation or restriction instructed by the Architect regarding ..., (vi) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limitation of working hours</mark>; or (vi) the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sequence</mark> of carrying our or completion work; or the addition or alteration to or omission of such obligations or restrictions imposed by the Contract", and should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wide enough to cover the present case</mark>.
	- The Contractor should demonstrate how the Works were delayed to what extent by compliance with the Guidance Notes over what he should have done to comply with the Statutory Requirements. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Compliance with changing Statutory Requirements is not a listed event for EOT</mark>.

### NSC suspend due to MC set off payment *(2011 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7.2.4. NSC suspend due to MC set off payment</mark>
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC cl.29.8(2) and NSC cl.33.1(7)</mark>, MC is entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deduct any amount properly deductible</mark> from the certified payment, and NSC only has the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">right to suspend work under NSC cl.33.14(1)</mark> for the residual payment or if the amount deducted is not proper. 
	- In accordance with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.29.8(3) and NSC cl.33.1(8)</mark>, if the Architect considered that the deduction is not proper, he should certify accordingly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">direct payment</mark>.
	- Valid suspension of work would not have a direct EOT entitlement under MC cl.25.1, but would entitle NSC to EOT under NSC cl.25.1(3)(u), which would in turn trigger MC cl.25.1(3)(m). This would appear to be unreasonable for Employer to be responsible for the MC's default. MC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.4</mark> provides a solution that the event was actually caused by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC's default</mark>, the event would not give entitlement to EOT.
	- In the present case, the suspension event was caused by MC not Employer, therefore, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no EOT</mark> would be justified.

### AI not affect progress *(2011 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">7.2.5. AI for fence off antiquity but not affect work progress</mark>
	- Valuation of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark> under cl.13.4.
	- EOT for variation under cl.25.1(3)(h), with L& E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(c).
	- EOT for arrangement in connection with discovery of antiquity under cl.25.1.(3)(k), with L&E entitlement under cl.27.1(2)(f).
	- In this case, there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no disruption to normal work progress</mark>. Therefore, no EOT nor L&E entitlement.

### Delay due to variation / late instruction (2017 D2Q3a)

- Contractual grounds
	- The delay claim may be based on delays due to variation or late instruction
- Variation
	- Identify the contract requirements for the roof panels and determine whether the Architect's reply constituted a variation under the Contract
	- The Particular Specification requires that the roof panels shall have SPF10. The Contractor's proposed polycarbonate panels are compliant in this regards. The yellowing consideration stated in the Architect's reply is not stated in the Particular Specification, but this may be the real issue to the Contractor. It should be the more expensive Plexiglass which is the real issue.
	- The preference for Plexiglass in the Particular Specification should not be interpreted as prevailing over the SPF10 requirement. If it is proven that Plexiglass does not have SPF10, then it would be reasonable for the Contractor not to have allowed for the more expensive Plexiglass. The Architect's request for using the more expensive Plexiglass should therefore be regarded as a variation under SFBC cl.13.1 which could entitled Contractor to EOT under cl.25.1(3)(h).
- Late instruction
	- The Contractor may also argue that the instruction was late, which being given at 1 month after the Contractor's submission of design under SFBC cl.25.1(3)(f). 
	- However, it should be checked to see whether the submission of the polycarbonate design 3 months before work on site was early enough or too late. Reasonably, sufficient time should be allowed for the Architect's comment, at least one revision and re-submission, material ordering and off-site fabrication. The 3 months' period appears to be too short. If it is proven that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">submission was late</mark> making the variation from polycarbonate to Plexiglass critical, then the delay caused by the variation should not be entitled to EOT.
	- Furthermore, the Contractor should have the duty to request for clarification over the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ambiguity</mark> of contract requirement between SPF10 and Plexiglass prior to submitting its design under cl.2.4

### Analysis of programme and delaying events *(2019 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Identify</mark> - A comparison between the two programmes shows:
	- Overall completion delayed by 15 days
	- Substructure construction increased from 30 days to 40 days by 10 days - on its own, it is on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path</mark> to the overall completion and would cause 10 days' <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay</mark>
	- Fabrication of rain shelter increased from 60 days to 85 days by 25 days - on its own, after using up the original <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">float</mark> of 10 days, the critical delay to the overall completion would be 15 days
- With hindsight, this may be very tempting to argue that Contractor should be responsible for the overall delay of 15 days. However, such a retrospective approach will often lead to a misinterpretation of the changing critical path
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In principle</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT should be granted as soon as the cause</mark> of delay starts to affect the progress to the extent that the effect of the delay can be estimated, with possible continual review of EOT. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">effects of many delays should be assessed individually</mark>, and each should be taken in a prospective manner as much as possible taking the situation existing at the time when the cause of delay starts to affect the progress.
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extended completion date</mark> promptly certified by Architect can be incorporated into the programme to serve as a new target for the remaining work. This would assist the Contractor who is obliged to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">update the programme to realistically reflect the latest situation</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Delay to substructure</mark>
	- At about day 40, the variation to the substructure works was expected to require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">10 extra days</mark> for construction
	- The substructure was on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path</mark> to the overall completion
	- The 10 extra days would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay the overall</mark> completion by 10 days
	- The delay to fabrication <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">did not happen yet and was irrelevant</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark> of 10 days should be granted 
	- If promptly granted and the programme updated, the original <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">float time for fabrication</mark> of rain shelter would be increased from 10 days to 20 days, and the shelter erection should start on day 71+10 = day 81
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A diagram is expected to illustrate the above</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Delay to the fabrication</mark>
	- On day 60, the transportation problem started to happen, but there was some float time
	- On day 70, the float time had all been used up but the delivery was still not finished
	- On day 85, the delivery was finished
	- The start of shelter erection was delayed from day 81 to day 86 for 5 days
	- The overall completion delay was 5 days due to Contractor
	- No EOT should be granted
- A diagram is expected to illustrate the above

### Delayed handover *(2020 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Delayed handover</mark>
	- The event was a postponement of Date for Possession of the site which would entitle the Contractor to EOT for critical delay so caused under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(j)(i)</mark>, and related L&E under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(e)(i) or (2)(k)</mark>
	- Contractor is required to complete the refurbishment works within 19 weeks for Block 1. Any delay in the handover would have full impact on the Contractor's progress to complete on time. The delay was therefore <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical</mark>. EOT should be granted to the Contractor for one week's delay of handover.
	- However, since <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no site establishment</mark> work would have carried out by Contractor before handover, L&E related to site establishment should be minimal and negligible. Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">might incur some project staff cost, overheads and inflation</mark>.
	- Bonus: it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">normal for LOA not to specify</mark> the actual handover / commencement date to give flexibility. The actual date will be stated in the Contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only if it is signed after the actual commencement</mark> date.

### VO *(2020 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Alteration of kitchen cabinets</mark>
	- Alteration of kitchen cabinets supplied by Employer would amount to a variation addition, particularly when the alteration was as instructed. The time pending the instruction may be regarded as a failure of Employer to supply on time.
	- An instructed <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark> addition would entitle Contractor to additional payment as variation under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.3(a)</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT for critical delay</mark> so caused (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(h</mark>)), and related <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E</mark> (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(c)</mark>)
	- In addition, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">failure of Employer to supply</mark> would entitle Contractor to EOT for critical delay so caused (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(r)</mark>) and L&E (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(j)</mark>)
	- However, it should be noted from baseline programme that work to the subsequent floor can only start one week after the start of the work to the preceding floor. This means that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">work to the preceding floor in the 2nd week would not be critical to the subsequent floor except for the last floor</mark>. If the kitchen cabinets were not required to be completed within the 1st week and only the 1st batch was affected, it is likely that the delays caused by the alteration work would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be critical</mark> to the completion of Block 1 leading to EOT. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No prolongation costs or L&E</mark> would be incurred. Some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruptive costs</mark> might be incurred when dealing with the alteration, which may be included in variation.

### Early commencement of part works *(2020 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Advancing flat 137-140 on 19/F of Block 2</mark>
	- According to the approved baseline programme, Contractor would have started work at Block 2 only after the works at Block 1 were completed. The change of programme requirement by Employer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">means</mark> that the four flats in Block 2 were started four weeks earlier than the rest of Block 2 and were expected to be completed within two weeks concurrent with the works to Block 1. This would be followed by a time gap of two weeks before the start of the rest of Block 2.
	- By putting the work out of phase, there will be additional cost incurred by Contractor because:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A loss of efficiency and productivity</mark> as there could be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra mobilization</mark> of resources for the four flats in advance of the rest of Block 2, with reduced volume of work limited to four flats instead of eight flats on 19/F
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Extra separation, cleaning and protection costs</mark> upon completion of the first four flats
	- Furthermore, after the completion of the first four flats, there would still be four flats on 19/F of Block 2 to complete. The overall time to complete the first four flats and the rest of Block 2 should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more than original 19 weeks</mark>. There would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be any saving in the site preliminaries</mark>. On the contrary, there would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolongation costs</mark> incurred by Contractor.
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC do not have provisions</mark> for Employer to order advancement of commencement date of a part or section of the works. If the Employer requires Contractor to start part earlier than, then <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contract will have the right to object</mark>, and consequently have the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">chance to negotiate</mark> for monetary compensation for the inefficiencies due to the overlap.
	- Bonus: the approved baseline programme shows that the works at Block 2 will only start after completion of the works of Block 1. This might have been the original intention. However, Contract only says Block 2 will be handed over to the Contractor 20 weeks after the date for commencement of Block 1. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It does not say that it must be after the completion of Block 1</mark>. If the constraint causing the apparent linkage can be removed, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer will have the right to ask Contractor to start Block 2 in week 20 without being affected by any delay in Block 1</mark>. The Contractor may argue that the overlap could cause him loss of efficiencies and productivity, but since delays to Block 1 are always possible but Contract has not stipulated no overlap, the Contractor cannot claim any L&E. Contractor also has an obligation to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mitigate</mark> the consequence of delay to Block 1. By not correspondingly delaying the start of Block 2 can help mitigate. 
	- Bonus: since Block 2 is only a part of whole of the works, Employer may request <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay recovery proposals</mark> to recover the delay to Block 1 by advancing the commencement of Block 2. SFBC cl.26 gives such a mechanism. The eventual results under SFBC are subject to mutual negotiation and agreement. 
	- Usually, the contractors would be co-operative to advance as far as practicable. In the present case, Contractor has complied with the instruction without objection, then the commencement of Block 2 should be deemed to have commenced on the commencement of the first floor flats. EOT would need to be granted for the extra four weeks with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">monetary compensation</mark> for the longer construction period <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">as if the event is a variation</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">under cl.13.3(a)</mark>. The monetary compensation could take into <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">account some savings when resources were shared between Block 1 and 2 during their overlap period</mark>. Other additional cost such as loss of efficiency and productivity as well as extra separation, cleaning and protection costs mentioned above are reimbursable.
	- If the Architect considers that the official commencement date should not count the first four flats, Contractor is still entitled to have 19 weeks to complete the rest of Block 2. Architect cannot under Contract unilaterally reduce the time by reason of separating and advancing a part of the works. The liability for monetary compensation would remain the same as that stated.

### Architect request less tea break / delivery by air to catch up delay *(2022 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">EOT whether less tea break / delivery by air</mark>
	- It is an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implied contract term</mark> that subject to compliance with the requirements regarding design, materials and workmanship, how to plant to have the Works carried out should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">at the discretion of the Contractor</mark>
	- Bonus: Conditions of Contract do require the Contractor to submit the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">master programme</mark> upon commencement of the Works for information under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 3.1</mark>. However, there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no specific requirement for the Architect to comment</mark>, though the Preliminaries usually say that the programme should be approved by the Architect.
	- Bonus: Customarily, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect would review</mark> whether the activities are logical and the time periods are reasonable. He may comment that some activities or milestones have been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">planned too late such that the risk of actual delay</mark> to the overall completion date may be high. He may comment that some activities have been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">planned too early for him to provide information</mark> to meet such that the Contractor may easily claim EOT.
	- Giving worker's tea breaks is an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">industry norm</mark>. Delivery by sea is also the default practice. Delivery by air is for special cases only.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the Contractor's programme can afford</mark> to have workers' tea breaks and delivery by sea, while still meeting the overall completion date, he is entitled to do so. The Contractor cannot be required to increase the explicit float times, though a prudent contractor should allow for implicit buffers in the activities.
	- If the Contractor's current progress is critically delayed by a certain period, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark> should compensate that period lost to the same extent.
	- Bonus: For example, if the Contractor is instructed (not due to his fault) to stop work for 1 days, he should be compensated for 1 day. It would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be reasonable</mark> to say that he still has 100 working days to complete the Works that he should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">absorb</mark> that 1-day delay totally or partially because 1/100 is a small percentage, otherwise, this would mean that the Contractor will not actually be compensated for the 1 day lost.
	- If the tea breaks are cancelled, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">workers' benefits will be affected and they will demand higher pay </mark>for the increased working hours if not leaving the project. If the delivery by sea is changed to by air, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costs of delivery will be increased</mark>. The Contractor would not have allowed such additional costs and should therefore not be required to bear the costs
	- Clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.1(4)</mark> does required the Contractor to use his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">best endeavors to mitigate</mark> the effect of any delays, but it does not mean that he has to reduce his remaining time to make up sum of the culpable delay. It further says that the endeavors should not increase the Contractor's cost.
