We refer to our previous fax dated xxxx and discussion at many occasions regarding the extension of time (EOT) assessments for the various contract packages of the captioned project.

As requested, we are pleased to summarise our contractual advise regarding the EOT assessments as follows for your reference:

- 1. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">General principle of assessment</mark>
	- 1.1 When the progress of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">works is delayed beyond the control of the Contractor</mark>, the Architect may grant EOT for completion of the works according to the provisions as stipulated in the Contract. [nature of EOT]
	- 1.2 In establishing whether any event has caused delay to the contract works which the Contractor is entitled to have EOT grantable, the following points should be considered: [criteria & consideration of EOT]
		- (a) The cause of delay is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">listed event</mark> stipulated under clause 25 of Conditions of Contract
		- (b) The listed event lies in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path</mark> of the construction programme.
		- (c) There is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual (not apparent) delay</mark> to the contract works caused by the event. 
		- (d) The event is solely due to causes which are out of the control of the Contractor and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not his own default</mark>. Should the event be a combination or knock-on effects of incidents which the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor is partly responsibility should be ascertained and considered</mark> in assessing the EOT grantable.
	- 1.3 The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">original programme</mark> submitted by the Contractor may be a useful reference and can act as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">basis for comparison with the actual work progress</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Consideration</mark> should be made for effects on the Contractor's programme and the actual work progress due to the actions by the Consultants or other third parties which the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Employer</mark> is responsible such as the issue of variation works etc as highlighted in para 1.2(d) above.
	- 1.4 The above gives only a general contractual review on the guidelines upon which the assessment of EOT should be based. The actual time period grantable after considering the actual delay caused solely by the Contractor's default is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">subject to the final assessment and adjudication by your office and the Architect / Engineer</mark>.
