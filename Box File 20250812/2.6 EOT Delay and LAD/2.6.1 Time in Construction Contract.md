## Duty of Employer & Contractor

- Employer
    - Not prevent Contractor from carrying out its obligations
    - Take reasonable steps to enable Contractor to execute the works
    - Prevention principle
		- Act of prevention by Employer 
- Contractor
    - Execute the works in orderly manner
    - Best endeavors to prevent delay (cl. 25.1(4))
        - Not obliged to spend additional money
        - Might include reprogramming, re-sequencing, revising method, reallocating (but not increasing) resources
 
## Time of Essence

- Concept
    - Failure to meet the particular date is a fundamental breach of contract
    - Result in repudiation & damages
- Time is seldom of essence in a construction contract
    - EOT & LAD clauses
        - Allow Contractor to complete late and accept LAD as compensation
    - Rationale
        - Contractor has to expend heavily in performing the contract prior to a delay
        - Employer received a major and irretrievable benefit
    - Possible to make time of essence
        - Serve a notice requiring completion by a certain date
 
## Time at Large

- Circumstances if acts of prevention by Employer (not neural event)
	- No contract provisions for EOT
	- Or EOT provisions are improperly administered or misapplied
	- Or there is a waiver of original time requirements
	- Or there has been interference by Employer in payment certification
- Consequences - time becomes at large
	- Employer loses right to have works completed within the specified time
	- MC obliged to complete within a reasonable time only
	- Employer cannot impose LD liability & loses right to recover LD
	- Employer can only claim general damages at common law
- Reasonable time
    - Hick (1893) defined by Lord Watson
    - Reasonable man test
		- The reasonable time should be taken be a reasonable contractor to carry out the works
 
## Float

- Time contingency
    - No EOT allowed until the float if exhausted
- Possible reasons for loss
    - Poor productivity
    - Changes in methodology which are inefficient
    - VO additional works
    - Lack of suitable labour, plants & materials
    - Poor workmanship causing works to be done twice
    - Breaking down of plants
- Ownership of float
    - Shared by all parties if not stated (Employer, MC, NSC, neutral event)
    - On first come first served basis 
    - NEC, JCT
	    - Shared and consumed on a first-come first served basis
    - Employer's argument to use float time
        - At this moment, no EOT will be granted for Employer's fault due to taking benefit of floats, but Architect will continue to review this situation.
        - If subsequently, any other non-excusable delaying events occur which cause real delay to the progress & Contractor had no EOT entitlement, and because the floats have already been used up by Employer, then Architect will grant EOT for such Employer's fault.
    - Contractor's recommendation
        - Hide floats in the durations of activities to ensure his exclusive use
        - Manipulate floats in resource allocation
