## General

- EOT purpose
    - Allow express alteration of contract requirement regarding time
    - Set up mechanism regarding delay and recovery measures
    - Avoid time at large due to breach of implied terms
    - Safeguard LAD clause and Employer's right to recover LAD
- Notice of delay not precedent to EOT entitlement under SFBC
    - If condition precedent and Employer's act of prevention, time at large
	- Gaymark (1999)
		- No notice from MC and time became at large 
- Failure to grant EOT may render time at large
 
## EOT Assessment

- Assessment assumption
	- Subject to proper substantiation from the Contractor and provided that the contract provisions in regard to Contractor's best endeavour to prevent delay have been properly complied with
- Nature
	- Not due to Contractor's own default
	- Cannot be prevented with Contractor's best endeavor
- Criteria
	- NOD
    - Event lies on critical path of the programme
    - Actual not apparent delay
	- Cause knock-on delay in overall completion of the works
        - No EOT if can use floats on programme to set off delay
    - Listed event cl. 25.1(3)
    - Contractor's best endeavours to prevent delay (cl. 25.1(4))
	    - Acceleration with additional cost & resources is not expected
	    - Reasonable mitigation
		    - Reprogramming and re-sequencing
		    - Revising the method statement
		    - Reallocating the resources
	- Consider contractor's default involved in delay (cl.25.4)
		- Consider
		- Actually support EOT shall be granted even if concurrent delay
- NOD
	- Not condition precedent unless specifically stated
	- If condition precedent & act of prevention, Contractor may argue time at large
		- Not time at large in actual case
		- Contractor may reply on prevention principle 
			- One cannot benefit from its own fault
	- If condition precedent & neutral event, no EOT
- Effect of delay
	- Based on programme
		- With regard to the time the Works were carried, not the time they were programme to be carried out
	- Consider subsequent effect of listed event
		- Subsequent making good and reinstatement
- Delay analysis
	- Contractor to submit master programme (cl.3.1)
    - Critical Path Method (CPM)
        - Use Baseline Programme analyse effect of delaying event on critical path
    - As-planned impacted programme (AIP)
        - Add delaying events to Baseline Programme
    - As-Built But-For (ABBF)
        - Use as-built programme and remove the delay
    - Window analysis (monthly)
        - Consider changing nature of the critical path and diminishing floats
- Omission of works (cl.25.3(5))
	- Consider but shall not earlier than original completion date
	- Contractor shall continue to proceed diligently as surplus time might be considered
- Fix new Completion Date
	- Net basis, dot on principle (see 2.6.2)
		- Add EOT to original completion date not date of instruction
		- Balfour Beatty v Chestermont (1996)
		- "net" basis instead of "gross basis"
			- "net": add to original completion date
			- "gross": add to the date of instruction
		- "_start with the existing completion date and postpone it to the extent which he considered as fair and reasonable having regard to the delay caused by the requirement to execute the variation instructions_."
	- Not render time at large
		- Balfour Beatty v Chestermont (1996)

### Implication of deleting neutral events (2002 Q 1.7)

- More <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risks</mark> are put onto Contractors
- Contractors' <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">interest in tendering</mark> may decrease
- Tenderers may require longer contract period or alternatively may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">increase the tender sums</mark> to cover the risks
- Contractors may have to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">compromise the standard and quality</mark> of the Works to catch up delays caused by these neutral events
- Contractors may be forced to become <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more claim conscious</mark> in order to recover time / money list due to delay caused by these neutral events
- Contractors may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">work more diligently</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Loss of chance to use neutral events as grounds for EOT in disguise of other events</mark> which may cause embarrassment to the PM or Consultants

### Late instruction

- Obligation
	- Architect has obligation to provide further dwg reasonably necessary for use (cl.5.6(1))
	- Contractor has obligation to require supplementary documents (cl.5.6(2))
- No provision that Architect need to issue drawing as stipulated in Contractor's programme 
	- Unless programme as work progress and reasonably necessary to provide at the time

## Procedure

- Obligation to mitigate (cl. 25.1(4))
    - Best endeavours to prevent or mitigate delay
    - Not obliged to spend additional money or accelerate
- Contractor's first notice of delay (cl. 25.1(1)&(2))
    - Give 1st notice to Archi within 28 days of event
    - Notice include:-
        - Likelihood and estimated length of delay
        - Material circumstances including cause of delay
        - Identify listed event
- Contractor's second notice (cl. 25.2)
    - Give 2nd notice within 28 days of 1st notice / commencement of delay
    - Notice include:-
        - Substantiation
        - Particulars including cause, effect, length of delay
    - Continuing effect
        - Interim particulars at intervals not exceeding 28 days
        - Final particulars within 14 days after delay ceasing
- Site meeting minutes are not good notice unless parties specifically amend the contract in this respect
- Architect to fix new Completion Date (cl. 25.3)
	- Time frame
		- Within 60 days after receipt of particulars in 2nd notice
		- In practice, determine EOT until the works are completed
			- Employer utilizes floats to set-off delays
		    - MC may accelerate at his own cost without a realistic completion date (constructive acceleration)
    - If no NOD
        - Archi may grant EOT based on information available
    - If omission of work after fixing new Completion Date
        - Archi may fix an earlier one if fair, but not earlier than original completion date
    - If EOT after Completion Date before Substantial Completion
        - Add EOT to the total EOT previously granted regardless time of delay occurrence
    - Archi can review EOT previously grant
	    - Between Completion Date and Date of Substantial Completion
        - Within 90 days after Substantial Completion or agreed later date
- Notice to NSC (cl. 25.6)
- NSC's EOT
	- MC assess, and Archi consent

### Strict NOD requirement to ensure time *(2019 D1Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Shorten the delay notice</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual feasibility</mark>
		- It is contractually feasible to shorten the contractual period for notifying delays so long as the contract provisions have clearly so state
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible benefits</mark>
		- It may help an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">early warning</mark> to the Architect and Employer for them to implement measure to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mitigation</mark> delay before it is too late
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible problems and issues</mark>
		- Without express words to the effect of imposing a time bar, any time frames specified can only be regarded as a matter of good practice. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Any failure to comply may not have serious implication to the effect of reducing EOT entitlement</mark>
		- Also, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time to start counting the period may not be concisely determinable</mark>, e.g. the usual phrase "the commencement of an event likely to cause delay" for the purpose of starting to count the period is not a precise term and may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cause different interpretations and arguments</mark>
		- The shortened notifying period may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cause Contractor to submit enormous number of NOD with insufficient details</mark> to cover every even which may cause possible or potential delay to safeguard his position. More time resources will be spent by Architect and Contractor to deal with these notices leaving less time to deal with more important matters.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect may not be able to respond</mark> to the enormous number NOD reasonably promptly and this may result in a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time-at-large argument</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time goal</mark>
		- The suggestion will not reduce the Contractor's EOT entitlement nor Contractor's actual possibility of delays
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Add condition precedent requirements</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual feasibility</mark>
		- It is contractually feasible to add more stringent requirements on notifying delays and submitting detailed claim particulars as conditions precedent to granting EOT
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible benefits</mark>
		- By making it more difficult to claim, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT entitlement may be reduced</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Possible problems and issues</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Conditions precedent may deal with</mark> the period for notifying delays and submitting detailed claim usually in the form of a <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">time bar</mark>, and with the particulars to be submitted usually in terms of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sufficiency</mark>
		- A <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">time bar</mark> in respect of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">neutral event</mark> will be more readily upheld than a time bar in respect of acts of delays or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preventions by Employer</mark>, the Architect or persons fro whom they are reasonable. For the time bars to be effective, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">intent must be expressly stated beyond doubt</mark>
		- As mentioned above, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">start time to count the permissible time can be difficult</mark> to ascertain
		- For the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">sufficiency</mark> of particulars to be submitted, it is always open to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">argument</mark> as to whether the particular are sufficient
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">administrative burden</mark> as mentioned above also apply here
		- Very stringent EOT provision may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">limit Architect's or the PM's flexibility to exercise discretion to resolve disputes</mark>. The dispute may end up in the more costly dispute resolution methods
		- More strignet requirements may attract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">higher prices or reduce tendering interest</mark>
		- If the specified contract period is estimated to be shorter than the realistic contract period, allowance for LAD will likely by included in the tender sums. This means the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract period is not really realistic</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time goal</mark>
		- The suggestion can reduce Contractor's EOT entitlement but is unlikely to reduce Contractor's actual possibility of delays
