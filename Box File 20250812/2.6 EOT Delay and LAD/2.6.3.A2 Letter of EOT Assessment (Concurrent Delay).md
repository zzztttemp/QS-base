<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">We refer to our recent discussion</mark> regarding C's further claim of EOT for inclement weather and public holidays <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">failing within the extended contract period</mark>.

C has submitted the claims for additional 28 days and 10 days of EOT for inclement weather and public holidays respectively within the extended contract period granted by Archi as per letter ref xxxx. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">We would like to advise as follows</mark>:-

- 1. Inclement weather
	- 1.1 <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">According to SCC xx & SP xx</mark>, the ground for EOT due to inclement weather has been <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deleted</mark>. Inclement weather <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">is excluded from being a listed event for EOT</mark>. This implies that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk of delay of the contract works due to the effect</mark> of inclement weather should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">borne by the Contractor</mark> accordingly.
	- 1.2 However, the Contractor's responsibility for the above risk <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">should be reassessed if</mark> inclement weather happens <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">within a period of delay caused by listed events which are grounds for EOT </mark>and not due to the Contractor's own fault, the reasons being:-
		- (a) <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">While the Contractor should have allowed</mark> in his tender for the risk due to the possible effects of inclement weather within the original contract period,<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> it may not be fair and equitable to imply that</mark> the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">risk due to the same incurred during a valid EOT </mark>to the original contract period and not arising from the Contractor's own fault, should be equally <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">within the reasonable contemplation of the Contractor at the time of tendering</mark>.
		- (b) The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">first delaying event</mark> which is not due to the Contractor's default gives rise to EOT. The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">second delaying event</mark>, i.e. inclement weather in this case, would not have caused delay to the works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">but for</mark> the first delaying event. In this respect, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">it may not be fair and equitable to neglect the effect of this second delaying event</mark> which is not due to the Contractor's default and therefore <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">render him liable to possible deduction of LD</mark>.
- 2. Public Holiday
	- 2.1 under clause 2 of FOT, the contract period shall be calendar days including all Sundays and public holidays. This implies that public holiday should be intrinsically regarded as a constituent of the contract time and its effect on the progress of work should therefore be considered also in the assessment of any extension to the original contract period which is based on valid contractual grounds.
- 3. EOT assessment
	- 3.1 According to clause 25 of Conditions of Contract, the Architect shall assess a fair and reasonable EOT for completion of the Works should be Works be delayed by the listed events stipulated.
	- Based on the propositions stated in Item (1) and (2) above, we reckon that the possible disturbance arising from inclement weather and public holiday to the progress of works already delayed by listed events, which is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not due to the Contractor's own default and which the Contractor, with his best endeavor, cannot prevent</mark> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">should also be considered</mark> in the assessment of a fair and reasonable extension
	- 3.2 However, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the following should be noted in considering</mark> the effects of the inclement weather and public holiday in the EOT assessment:-
		- (a) Whether the effects to the progress lie in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path</mark> of the construction work
		- (b) Whether there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual (not apparent) delay</mark> to the contract works. The statement regarding the amount of rainfall per day may not be totally relevant. The actual effect to the work progress due the inclement weather should be assessed instead.
		- (c) The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">effects of delay should be assessed</mark> with regard to the time the Works were carried out, not when they were programme to be carried out
