## General

- LAD - enforceable
	- LAD is a sum agreed by Employer and Contractor in advance as the amount to be paid by the Contractor as damages if Contractor breaches the Contract by failing to complete the Works on time.
	- Enforceable if genuine pre-estimate of possible loss judged at the time of entering into Contract
	- No need to prove / not affected by actual loss
	- Compensatory not punitive
- Penalty - not enforceable
	- "In terrorem (threat) of the offending party"
	- "Extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss which could conceivably be provided to have followed from the breach"
- Unliquidated damage - no matter LAD enforceable or not
	- Under common law to compensate actual loss
	- Require proof
	- No unliquidated damages if there exist LD clause
- LAD v penalty
	- Court's consideration
		- Freedom of contract
		- Intention of the parties at the time of making the contract, not breach
		- Contributory fault
		- Express word used is not conclusive
		- Relative bargaining power
		- Judge at the time of making the contract, not breach 
	- Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co v New Garage and Motor Co (1915)
		- Outdated test: genuine pre-estimation of loss
	- Cavendish Square Holding BV v El Makdessi, ParkingEye Ltd v Beavis (2015)
		- New test: unenforceable if it is all out of proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation
	- Principle in Jeancharm case
		- Look at substance of the matter rather than the form of words
		- Question at the time of making the contract not breach
		- Whether distinct from genuine pre-estimate of loss
		- Whether amount is extravagant or unconscionable in comparison with the greatest loss that could be perceived
- Purpose of LAD
    - Enable the Employer to recover a fixed sum as compensation for delay
    - Prevent the difficulty and expenses of proving the actual damages
	    - Payable irrespective of actual loss (BFI Group of Companies v DCB Integration Systems Ltd)
    - Avoid claiming unforeseeable loss
    - Avoid dispute in calculating and substantiating the actual loss, and possible proceedings
    - Contractor can be certain about risk exposure
- Time at large
    - No LAD available, general damages
- LAD too high
	- Might be penalty not enforceable
	- Might deter tenderers from tendering

## Administration of LD Clause

- Employer's discretion to deduct or set-off LAD (cl.40)
	- Notice at least 7 days before deduction - condition precedent
	- Not Architect / QS
- Condition precedent
	- Validity of LD clause
	    - LD must not be a penalty
	    - Time not at large
	- Administration of LD clause
	    - Non-Completion Cert
	    - EOT all addressed
	    - Not yet issuance of Final Cert
- QS to ensure sufficient outstanding amount for LAD deduction
- Procedure
    - Employer's notice (cl. 24.2)
    - Refund with interest if Completion Date revised (cl. 24.3)
- Sectional completion
    - Reduce LD in proportion
- NSC's delay
	- NSC liable for MC's damage including MC's LD to Employer
	- LD amount usually same as MC's

## Non-Completion Certificate

- Architect to certify (cl. 24.1)
    - Pre-condition
        - All claims for EOT addressed
        - Extended Completion Date passed
    - Can cancel is a new Completion Dated fixed afterwards
- Condition precedent to LAD deduction
 
## LD Calculation

- Calculated / advised by QS, confirmed by Employer
	- Employer may opt to provide his own estimate of LD 
- Method
    - Based on financial cost & cost of capital to the Employer
    - Based on contract value and contract period (Gov project)
    - Based on cost of accelerating the work
- Component
    - Cost of capital
	    - Cost of financing the project
        - Loss of revenue or interest on the capital invested in project
	- Loss of sale or rental income
    - Additional cost due to delay
        - Site supervision cost
        - Administrative expense
        - Additional professional fees, legal costs, agency fees, etc.
        - Additional statutory fees, government rents or rats
        - Additional fluctuation payable to Contractor (if fluctuation payable)
    - Special damages
        - Delay to completion of other contracts
        - Additional cost of operation
	        - Due to running a less efficient facility until the replacement facility is available 
	        - Due to alternative accommodation
        - Intangible loss or social cost which may be assessed from a cost-benefit analysis for public projects
        - Compensation to third party loss for breach of agreements due to delay
        - Additional opening / pre-opening costs
    - Loss of profit is too remote and not enforceable
- Minimum amount of LD
	- Might set a min if proportional reduction for sectional completion cannot reflect the real effect of delay
- Check and revise
	- Check before tender invitation
	- Check during tender as TA may change scope
	- Check before LOA, negotiate with tenderer to amend
	- Post contract variation by SA
- Limitation
	- Sometimes, full LAD may be out of proportion compared with tender sum, and deter tenderers from tendering
 
## Contractor's Defense Against LD

- Burden on proof on party making the challenge
- Penalty
    - No fixed amount, set max & min limit
    - Extravagant and not genuine pre-estimate of possible loss
    - If challenge, Contractor to prove
- Time at large
    - No definite completion time
    - Act of prevention by Employer
    - No EOT clause or not properly administered
    - Employer's interference with certification

### Contractor's challenge of LAD *(2023 D2Q1b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">B. LAD challenge</mark>
	- The rate of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">LAD</mark> is a pre-agreed rate between Employer and Contractor for the damages to be paid by the Contractor is the Contractor fails to complete the Works on time
	- It is general <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">rule</mark> that the rate of LAD should be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genuine pre-estimate</mark> of the loss that the Employer would suffer. The Courts will not enforce the LAD provision if they find the rate of LAD not a genuine pre-estimate of the loss, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extravagant and punitive</mark>. However, so long as it is genuine at the time of the estimate, it does not matter if the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual loss</mark> turns out to be very different in the future.
	- Bonus: It may be argued that the Contractor has <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">agreed</mark> to the rate of LAD by signing the Contract, but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Courts do deal with the challenges</mark> and accept the challenges in some cases.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Different LAD rates for different milestones</mark>
		- So long as the total of LAD rates of various milestones are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not bigger than the reasonable rate of LAD</mark> if there is only one completion date, then higher LAD rates for later milestones are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not self-evident</mark> that such higher LAD rates were not genuine pre-estimate of the loss, take for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">example</mark> that the earlier milestone is for the completion of a part of the Works while the later milestone is for the the completion of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">twice the size of the previous part</mark>.
		- Only if the functional value of the later milestone is bigger than the functional value of the earlier milestone, the challenge may stand. However, the LAD rates specified in the Contract may have been set smaller than the genuine pre-estimates of the loss because if the genuine rates are used, the tenderers may be deferred from tendering or may have to allow for a huge price for the risks. Therefore, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD rates may be discounted rates</mark>, but because the later milestones are more important, higher LAD rates have been specified.
		- If the above examples still cannot convince Contractor, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor should be required to submit his proof</mark> that the LAD rates are not genuine pre-estimate of loss. On the other hand, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if Employer can prove</mark> that they are genuine pre-estimate of loss, the LAD rates should still be enforceable.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">LAD rate higher than other projects</mark>
		- The fact that the LAD rates are higher than other similar projects does not mean that LAD rates are unreasonable.
		- LAD rates may take into account the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">following loss and expense</mark> caused by late completion:-
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Loss of sales</mark> of the completed properties
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Loss of rental income</mark> from the completed properties
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">opening / pre-opening costs</mark>
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operation costs</mark>
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">staff cost</mark> in handling project delay
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">professional fees</mark>, legal costs, agency fees, etc.
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Compensation for any breach</mark> of agreements in connection with the delayed use of the properties
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">statutory fees</mark>, government rents or rates, etc.
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">financing costs</mark>
		- The magnitude of the above items may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">vary a lot among different companies</mark> and similar projects. Furthermore, as mentioned above, LAD rates may be subject to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">different discounts by different companies</mark> for different projects. Therefore, the apparent difference in LAD rates cannot be a ready proof that the LAD rates are unreasonable.
		- As mentioned above, if the Employer can prove that they are genuine pre-estimate of loss, the LAD rates should still be enforceable
	- Bonus: able to discuss the difference between LAD and delay damages, and able to point out the LAD in the question is the same as the damages for non-completion in SFBC <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">clause 24</mark>
	- Bonus: able to point out that even if Contractor can successfully challenge LAD provision, Employer may claim for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">unliquidated damages</mark> as a result of the delayed completion caused by Contract.

	- Inform MC the qualification and require MC to price for the risks and absorb the shortfall
- LAD calculated based on % or formula is enforceable provided
	- Calculation of an accurate estimate of LAD is difficult
	- Intention is not to penalise the contractor
	- Formula is a genuine attempt to estimate in advance the Employer's loss

	- NSC in breach shall pay L&E incurred by MC including LAD
	- Irrespective of sub-contract value

### Sliding scale of LAD *(2013 D1Q2a)*

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD is</mark> a sum agreed by Employer and Contractor in advance as the amount to be paid by the Contractor as damages if Contractor breaches the Contract by failing to complete the Works on time.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">For a LAD provision to be enforceable</mark>, the rate fixed should represent a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genuine pre-estimate</mark>, judged at the time the Contract is entered into, of the likely loss which may arise if the Works are delayed, and would be applied to the period of delay, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without the need to prove the actual loss </mark>and irrespective of any deviations between the pre-estimate and the actual loss. 
- However, a LAD provision will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be enforced</mark> even if the Contract is agreed and signed if the rate fixed is more than the genuine pre-estimate and constitutes an improper <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">penalty</mark>. If the rate fixed is found to be "extravagant or unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss which could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach", it will be held to be a penalty. LAD is compensatory, not punitive. It cannot be arbitrary and must relate to the consequence of late completion.
- The proposed LAD provision if different from the usual LAD provision because it provides for a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sliding scale of LAD rates instead of a uniform</mark> LAD rate. The daily rate of LAD will be increased form $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day after the first 14 days of delay. Such <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">drastic increase could be perceived as a deterrent and therefore a penalty</mark>. It is therefore of prime importance to document the principle or basis of how the sliding scale of LAD was fixed. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If</mark> the sliding scale is consistent with the genuine pre-estimated loss pattern for the delay, the provision is enforceable. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Otherwise</mark>, the provision may amount to an unenforceable penalty clause. It may stand the challenge if $250,000 per day was in fact a genuine pre-estimate and $100,000 per day was purposely made lower. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It may stand if after a certain date, a special event would occur</mark> that the genuine pre-estimated loss would increase drastically. However, the date should likely be a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fixed calendar rather than relating to the contract or extended Date for Completion</mark> both of which Dates are generally floating at the time of tendering to permit the pre-estimate genuine to use 14 calendar days after them as the triggering date.

### No LAD for minor works *(2013 D1Q2b)*

 - If the Employer does not include a LAD clause in the Contract at all, the Employer may seek <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">recovery of general / actual damages</mark> for a delay caused by Contractor but the Employer has the legal burden to prove his actual loss and expense caused by the delay <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">with detailed substantiation and documentation</mark>, which may not be easy especially when proving and isolating the cause and effect relationship from other concurrent items.
- Should the parties have dispute over the determination of damages, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">costly and time consuming legal proceedings</mark> are generally inevitable.
- From the tenderer's point of view, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">absence of LAD will pose uncertainty in his risk exposure</mark> in case the project is delayed by him. If the actual damages are related to the whole project, the amount could well exceed his tender sum. He would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not tender</mark> for the Contract.
- Facing the impracticability to put high rate of LAD or alternatively seek general damages, the possible <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">alternative measures</mark> would be to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">commission the Drain Survey as early as possible</mark>, or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">include it in the major contract</mark> for the more capable one to bear the risk, or consider constructing new drains. 

### LAD for milestone dates *(2016 D1Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Failure to meet milestone dates on an agreed construction programme</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cannot</mark> make the Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">liable for delay damages</mark> because he is free to plan his works to meet the Contract Completion Date or Sectional Completion Date only
- Specify <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">LAD for milestone date</mark> in Contract
	- To be entitled to delay damages for the Contractor's failure to meet the milestone dates, the Employer must have such entitlement <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specified in the Contract</mark>. However, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unlikely that a milestone can be agreed after the award</mark> of the Contract with liability for delay damages but without reciprocity 互惠 benefits to the Contractor.
	- Specifying the milestone dates with rates of LAD would have the following <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advantages</mark>:
		- Meeting the milestone dates would become the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">commitment</mark>
		- Failure to meet a milestone date would entitle the Employer to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD</mark>
		- LAD are more <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">convenient</mark> to the Employer than general damages which require proof
		- Rate of LAD offer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">certainty</mark> to the Contractor when pricing his tender
	- A special contract clause would need to be drafted
	- However, conducting a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genuine estimate of LAD for failure to meet a milestone date is difficult</mark>, if no impossible, due to the following <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasons</mark>:
		- In the case of milestone <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">without involving handover</mark> to parties other than the Contractor, it is difficult to identify and estimate the loss and expense. The likely types of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss and expense must be made known</mark> to the tenderers in order for the loss and expense to be accepted as within the contemplation of the Contractor to quality for compensation as damages
		- Multiple LAD for different milestone dates could <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">add up to an amount extravagant</mark> to be a genuine estimate of the potential loss and expense due to delay to Contract completion
		- There <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may not be any loss and expense</mark> at all after missing a milestone dates if the Contractor can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">catch up the delay</mark> in the end
	- Care must therefore be exercised in estimating and specifying the rates of LAD otherwise they may be regarded as penalties and rendered unenforceable.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Other measures</mark> to encourage meeting milestone dates
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Draft a clause</mark> in the Contract to the effect that the Employer is entitled to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">withhold a stipulate sum from interim payments</mark> for failure to meet a milestone date but the sum is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">refundable</mark> to the Contractor upon Contract completion subject only to the usual LAD or refundable whenever he can catch up the progress in any subsequent milestone.
	- Make the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">payment terms</mark> contingent upon the achievement of the milestone dates, i.e. payment not yet due when a milestone date is not yet achieved. This may give a better impression than withholding a stipulated sum from a payment otherwise due, though the essence is the same.
	- Introduce a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bonus scheme</mark> incentivizing the Contractor to meet the milestone dates.
	- In all above cases, it is crucial that the special contract clause should also deal with:
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT for achieving milestones</mark> due to any Employer's act of prevention of performance
		- The possibility of the criteria of a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">milestone not responsive to actual circumstances</mark> making the milestone not achievable, which would create undue hardship to the Contractor
