Dear Architect, 

With reference to the above project and your letter dated xxxx regarding the proposed approach to granting EOT to the Contractor, we would like to comment as follows:-

Contractually, EOT <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">must be granted</mark> for the events which cause a delay to the Works<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">, whether they are beneficial to the Employer or not</mark>. In the case of the associated financial claims from the Contractor, these can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only be assessed based upon the provision of clause 27</mark>.

In view of the above, we would suggest that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">genuine cause of the delay is considered and the appropriate EOT is granted to the Contractor</mark>. Once the EOT has been assessed and awarded, the question of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">any financial claim could be considered as a separate exercise</mark>. In general, we would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not recommend the direct linking</mark> of an EOT award to the reimbursement of any financial claim submitted by the Contractor.

We hope that the above comments are of use to you.

Regards,
QS
