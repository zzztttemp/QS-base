## Actions to Avoid Determination

- Make sure work being properly done, follow AI
- Make sure materials properly stored and protected 
- Not remove materials and plant already paid by Employer
- Enhance record keeping
- Work in detail for payment valuation

## Default by Contractor (cl.35.1)

- Default (cl.31.1(1))
	- Completely or substantially suspending the carrying out of the Works without good cause
	- Not proceeding regularly and diligently with the Works
	- Not complying with AI under cl.8.3 for materials not in accordance
	- Not complying with cl.19.1 by assigning management role to others
	- Not complying with cl.19.2 by sub-letting whole or substantially the whole to the same person
- Procedure
	- Notice of default by Architect (cl.31.1(1), (2))
	- Contractor continues default for 14 days (cl.31.1(3)(a))
	- Architect certifies (cl.35.1(3)(b))
	- Notice of determination by Employer (cl.35.1(3))
	- If Contractor ends default (cl.35.1(5))
		- Contractor continue or resume
		- Architect certifies
		- Notice of determination by Employer within a reasonable time
	- Determination takes effect on the date of receipt (cl.35.1(4))
- Wrong procedure may lead to repudiatory breach of Contract. The matter, timing and formality must be handled with extreme care
	- Send by special delivery (cl.1.10)

### Determination due to delay *(2017 D2Q2)*

- Based on the give facts that the Contractor has an unsatisfactory progress of works, clause 35.1(a), (c), (d) and (e) are therefore irrelevant. The Architect is probably referring to the Contractor's failure to proceed regularly and diligently with the works under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.35.1(1)(b)</mark>.
- However, a programme delay of 4 weeks does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not by itself provide conclusive proof</mark> of a lack of due diligence
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme may not have been updated for all kinds of delays</mark> (with or without extension of time entitlement) to serve as a realistic programme for monitoring
- The 4 weeks' delay may be the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">result of accumulation over a long time</mark> and it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no longer feasible to catch up</mark>
- The Contractor may have been working very regularly and diligently but because of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">site problems</mark> the progress has not been satisfactory.
- Much <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">more evidence is required</mark> such as:
	- Failing to achieve the programmed productivity because of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inadequate resourcing</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Diminishing resources</mark> without justifiable grounds
	- Actual resources <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deployed are far less than what were planned</mark>
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">record in the minutes cannot serve as a notice of default</mark> under cl.35.1(1)
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procedures described above should be strictly followed</mark> in order to invoke determination
- To conclude, none of the ingredients of a valid determination under the Contract has been established at this moment and it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pre-mature for the Employer to issue a notice of determination</mark>.

## Insolvency of Contractor (cl.35.2)

- Insolvency
	- Bankrupt
	- Make a composition or arrangement with creditors
	- Have a petition for compulsory winding-up 
	- Enter into compulsory or voluntary liquidation except for the purpose of reconstruction
	- Have a provisional liquidator or receiver
- Determination takes effect on the date of receipt

## Employer's Rights (cl.35.3)

- Contractor not remove any materials, temporary buildings, plant until AI
- Employer given a lien (抵押权) upon all belonging to Contractor
- Employer provide site security if Architect not satisfied, cost recoverable

## Consequences of Determination (cl.35.4)

- Insurance remain in effect until left
- Contractor return site possession
- If AI, Contractor remove materials, temporary building, plant, except already property of Employer, or AI to leave on site
- Else, Employer can remove and sell, expense recoverable
- Employer pay other to complete
- Contractor assign

	- Benefit within 14 days
- Employer pay for materials, plant after determination at rates in the relevant agreement between Contractor and sub-con

## Good Practice for Determination by Default

### Good practice before serving notice of determination

- Document the circumstances justifying determination
- Enhance record keeping of workdone, material delivery, plant, defects and labour force, all AI & EOT must be up-to-date
- Keep the matter confidential
- Hold a meeting with Employer, all consultants & legal advisor, and discuss the issues: -
	- Recommended date of determination
	- Whether freeze the certified payment if determination is foreseen in short period / before insolvency
	- Prepare the action to set-off against the default MC
	- Estimate the consequence of determination including delay in completion & increase in cost
	- Call bond to recover
	- Consider alternatives to determination
		- Supplementary agreement, novation, omission of works, etc.
- Notice of default and copy to bondsman
- Require the default MC and bondsman a written undertaking to waive their rights to terminate -minimize potential legal risks
- NSC
	- Consider direct payment to NSC if Contractor withhold payment
		- Unwise to do so in case of liquidation unless liquidator's written consent is obtained beforehand
	- Obtain a written agreement which NSC agrees to complete the works after the direct payment in case of MC's determination
- Employer is obliged to honour payment according to certified amount before determination

### Good practice upon serving notice of determination

- Contract procedure of determination
- Inform bondsman with copy of the written notice of determination
- Inform the insurer and the Employer to arrange for insurance
- Record additional cost incurred during determination
- Re-possession of the site
	- Prohibit removal of plant, temp building and materials
	- Enhance site security if necessary
	- Keep specialist contractors working on site
	- Arrange continuous provision of utility services
	- Assess the need for emergency works and carry out
- Prepare site survey
	- Record quantity, value of works and defects
	- Record plant, materials and temporary buildings on site
- NSC
	- Secure assignment right of NSC
	- Renominate new NSC or direct them to form sub-contract with completion MC
	- Ensure MC to provide proof of payment to NSC
	- Inform NSC to remove unfixed material until proof of ownership is established
- Prepare technical and financial proposals for completion of outstanding works
- Freeze the payment, then establish the debt asap before the default MC terminates the contract by the reason for non-payment for a continuous period
- No further payment until final settlement
- Mitigate loss reasonably

### Good practice after determination

- Prepare completion contract
	- Ensure works re-commence and complete quickly and economically by either re-tendering a new contract, or use the existing contract terms
- Decision on NSC & other contracts
	- Consider assignment of hire-purchase agreement of plants, NSC and other specialist works contracts
	- Arrange existing NSC to enter sub-contract with the completion MC at the same contract price; consider alternative arrangement as well
- Settlement with MC & recover damage
	- Prepare hypothetical final account
	- Ascertain and certify loss & damage caused to the Employer
	- Prepare statement of debt recoverable
	- Call bond

## Good practice for Completion Contracts

- Arrange a meeting with employer, all consultants to consider the best way to complete the contract
- Any emergency work by other MC under cost-plus basis
- Prepare tender documents ASAP, considering : - 
	- Front part preparation
		- Re-use original BQ to save time
		- Use identical terms to Original Contract as far as possible
		- Re-evaluate LD by pro-rata
		- Re-evaluate specification
		- Prepare agreed conditions of works certifying the liabilities at determination, re-commencement and DLP
	- Define scope of works
		- Prepare a schedule of state of works at commencement
		- List of drawings of finished and outstanding works
		- Status of outstanding design
		- List of plant & unfixed materials left on site
		- List of approved materials & suppliers under Original Contract
		- List of NSC under Original Contract
		- List of defective works, define defects liability
		- List of relevant correspondence having contractual or cost implication including AI, CVI, clarifications on drawings, etc.
		- Daywork schedule
		- Warranty undertaking liability of works completed or partially completed by Original Contractor
	- Joint survey if necessary
- Obtain approval from bondsman regarding the method of completion
- Arrangement of original NSC
	- Direct contract or under completion contract
	- Consideration
		- Ability to continue, acceptability by completion contractor
		- Site work progress, amount of outstanding work
		- Performance, price
- Re-programming / re-phasing the works
- Ensure mitigating the cost to the default contractor
	- Price quoted without tendering may be challenged by original Contractor
- Procurement strategy
	- May arrange 2 separate completion contracts
		- Interim contract
			- Cost reimbursement basis
			- For security, half-finished works (not all), making good defects
		- Completion contract
			- For outstanding works
	- Consider 2 nd lowest tenderer
		- Already studied contract documents
		- Previous site visit and inspection
		- Already assessed on both technical & financial aspects
		- Relatively competitive price for the outstanding works
		- Save time for re-tendering
	- If large amounts, more attractive to completion MC -> lump sum
	- If small amounts, less attractive to completion MC -> cost plus basis
	- If works substantially completed -> might direct contracts with specialist contractors
- Why new completion MC
	- Lack of warranty for work executed
	- Level of defects
	- Delay incurred by the default MC & LD liability
	- Employee / SC may damage the site & equipment
	- Poor profit margins

## Good Practice for Determination by Insolvency

- Before insolvency
	- Keep the matter confidential
	- QS to check if MC have paid NSC as certified
	- QS valuation shall be as accurately as possible, resist undervalue / overvalue
	- Archi additional vigilance about work progress
	- COW ensure no materials leave the site after delivery
	- Make preliminary plan for safe guarding & protection confidentially
- Upon / after determination
	- Employment automatically determined at the time of insolvency
		- MC & NSC determinate 
		- No further payment until settlement
	- Ensure site security
		- Site should be closed and no materials or plant allowed to leave
		- It is safest to assume all MOS are in the ownership of Employer, and it is up to the trustee in bankruptcy or sub-con to prove any particular materials are not vested in the Employer
		- Engage a watchman to avoid losing material
		- Maintain services and protect existing works
	- Site survey
		- Prepare a list of unfixed materials on site
		- Plant hired / owned by Contractor
			- Secure the plant and notify liquidator to remove
	- Maintain insurance
	- NSC
		- Secure assignment right of NSC
		- Ensure MC to provide proof of payment to NSC
		- Inform NSC to remove unfixed material until proof of ownership is established
		- If direct payment to NSC, seek liquidator approval first or under a petition
			- If no approval of liquidator, invalid under law of insolvency
	- Recover as much money as possible from the default MC
		- Sale of plant, temp building and unused materials if legal to do so
		- Call bond with evidence
		- Refund of some insurance premium
	- Prepare final account
	- Check with liquidator possibility of reinstatement
	- Mitigate loss reasonably 
	- Outstanding works
		- Meeting to consider method of completing the contract
		- Prepare programme and estimate of cost for the completion of works
		- Keep liquidator informed about outstanding works

## Alternatives to Determination

- Supplementary agreement 
	- Release MC's liability to LD by fixing a new completion date
	- Reason: less expensive in the long run in terms of time and cost
- Omit part of the works on terms agreed
- Term contractor to carry out minor outstanding works
	- Additional cost set-off against default MC
- Reinstate the employment of insolvent MC (liquidators)
	- Reinstatement
		- Restoring a contract that was previously terminated due to the insolvency
		- For liquidator to maximize assets
		- Require consent from the other party
		- Bound by terms of original contract
	- Reinstatement by assignment
		- Substitute contractor to take the benefits and burdens of existing contract
		- Deed of assignment between Employer, contractors, liquidator & substitute contractor
	- Reinstatement by novation
		- Similar but it is unlikely that substitute contract will take over all liability
	- NSC's position
		- Determine immediately by determination of MC's employment
		- For assignment, Employer no need to pay any more
		- For novation, likely NSC will have a higher price for completion of works
- Permit assignment of benefits to a substitute MC
	- Deed of assignment formed between employer, default MC / liquidators, substitute MC & bondsman
	- Only transfer benefit (right) not obligation (liability), original MC remains liable for all obligations
	- Application
		- When employer wants to retain the ability to hold the default MC accountable for breaches
- Transfer the contract to a new contractor by novation
	- Deed of novation is formed between employer, default MC / liquidators, substitute MC & bondsman
	- Transfer benefit (right) and obligation (liability), including LD
	- Substitute MC to take over all liabilities on
		- Making good of patent & latent defects
		- Loss or damage of MOS, plant & equipment
		- Any delay in completion under original contract terms
		- Remaining NSC works
		- Insurance costs
	- Advantages
		- Prevent lengthy re-tender process
		- Allow early completion of remaining works
		- NSC can continue to work with proper arrangement of past due payments
	- Application
		- When the employer wants a clean break from default MC and is confident the substitute MC's ability to fulfill the contract

## Prevention of Determination by Default / Insolvency

- Prequalification
	- To examine financial capacity the Contractor's audited account for the past few years
	- To examine reputation
- Tender analysis
	- To carefully examine unreasonable low bid, accept non-lowest tender if necessary
- Contractual
	- To obtain bonds, guarantees
	- To arrange direct payment to sub-contractors
	- Advance payment if necessary to ease contractor's cash flow
- Contract admin
	- To treat contractor fairly, do not drive them into a corner
