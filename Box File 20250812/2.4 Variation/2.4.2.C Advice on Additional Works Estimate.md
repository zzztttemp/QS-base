Dear Sirs,
 
PROJECT NAME  
MAIN CONTRACT  
VARIATION TO WATERPROOFING SYSTEMS AT WATER TANKS
 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Further to your letter ref. xxx dated xx/xx/xxxx regarding our estimated cost for</mark> the addition of waterproofing system to fire service, sprinkler and drencher water tanks, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">we feel the need to clarify the situation relating to our cost estimate for your further consideration.</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">There are three possible interpretations as to the cost for the said works according to our understanding after the telephone discussion with your xxx on xx/xx/xxxx and they are listed as follows :</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Case 1 (Contractor's default)</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If</mark> the leakage of water tanks is due to the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor's faulty workmanship</mark> on concrete works <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">(which the Architect is yet to determine)</mark> and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">this consequently leads to</mark> the addition of liquid applied waterproofing membrane and associated related works for rectification, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">any additional costs related to the same should be borne by the Contractor, not the Employer.</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Case 2 (Variation - fair)</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the Architect considers</mark> that, for better quality / durability of the works irrespective of the quality of the concrete works executed or <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">for other reason not due to the Contractor's fault, it is necessary to issue instruction</mark> to add liquid applied waterproofing membrane and associated related works to the water tanks, and more specifically instructs the use of Tremco liquid applied waterproofing membrane, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">this may constitute a valid variation to the Contract</mark>.
 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Not having been informed of the background, this is what we had interpreted</mark> from your letter ref, xxxx dated xx/xx/xxxx under which Tremco is the named waterproofing material confirmed to be added and applied with details in accordance with the drawing No. xxxx issued under Contract Instruction No. xxxx and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">our cost estimate</mark> as per our letter dated xx/xx/xxxx <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">had been provided accordingly.</mark>
 
 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In determining the unit rate</mark> for Tremco, please be informed that there is no contract rate or similar rate for such material and we consider that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">a fair valuation thereof shall be made in accordance with the Contract clause 13.4(1)(iii)</mark> as per out detailed cost estimate enclosed under our letter dated xx/xx/xxxx i.e. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">an estimate nett additional cost of $xxxx.</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Case 3 (Variation - similar)</mark>
 
 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Same as Case 2 above but</mark> this time if Contractor is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">only instructed to use the same</mark> DIC or other approved polyurethane waterproof material as to general roof as described in the Specification, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the contract rate for</mark> supply and laying polyurethane waterproofing or approved equivalent to general roof <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">shall be used as a basis for assessment after taking into consideration</mark> of the restricted working condition inside water tank <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">in accordance with the Contract clause 13.4(1)(ii)</mark>.
 
If this interpretation is to be adopted, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">our estimate is a nett additional cost of $xxxx.</mark>
 
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">For avoidance of doubt and to facilitate the settlement of final account with Contractor, we would be obliged if you could confirm to us which of the above interpretation or, if not, please specify the one you are adopting at your soonest.</mark>
