	- Establishment charges, overhead charges and profit

## Variation in Work

- Monetary claim usually mean L&E not VO
- Variation (cl.1.6)
    - Change required to the design, quality or quantity of the Works  
	    - Material, works
	    - Access, working space, working hour, sequence
    - Or the imposition of or change to any obligation or restriction
- Basis for Variation
	- Change of design, spec, requirements (cl.13.1)
	- Discrepancies in contract documents (cl.2.4(2))
	- Discrepancies between statutory requirements and contract documents (cl.6.2(2))

            - Works deliberately executed, knowing it to be wrong instructed
                - Contractor may have waived his right to avoid the Contract rates (Peter Kiewit Sons' Company of Canada Ltd. V Eakins (1960))
- Remedies for above
	- SA
	- Quantum meruit
- If no VO provision
	- Changes are not permitted under Contract
	- MC is not obliged complete the variation

## Quantum Meruit

- Circumstances
	- Where a contract is entered into without an agreement as to how the works will be paid for
	- Where the contract expressly provides that the contractor will be paid a reasonable price
	- Where the works are down at the wish of one party before a contract is entered into
	- Works outside a contract
- Measurement
	- Reasonable cost
	- Agreed tender price is irrelevant
	- A party could not claim payment for extra time for its own default or defective works
- Contractor might claim quantum meruit for substantially different scope
	- Henry Boot case shows that the Contract is sacred and not subject to correction
	- Rare for conditions to be sufficient to make the works substantially different

## Contractor's Proposal

- Usually in Preliminaries
	- Any proposal made by the Contractor and approved by the Architect shall be deemed to have no cost and time effect on the Contract
	- Unless Contract expressly states that there should be cost or time effect when submitting the proposal and the Architect confirms in writing to treat this proposal as Variation when accepting the proposal
- Proposed materials
	- If C to select, fit for purpose (cl.8.1(2))
	- If not procurable, C to propose (cl.8.1(3))
		- Similar, no adjustment
		- Not similar, VO


### Contractor's alternative proposal *(2014 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Variation or not</mark>
	- By <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.1, Variation refers to</mark> a change instructed by Architect to the design, quality or quantity of the Works or the imposition of an obligation or restriction instructed by Architect regarding access, working space, working time or working sequence. A Variation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">must have an Architect's instruction</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cl.8.1(3)</mark> states that if any of the specified materials or goods are not procurable, then Contractor shall submit alternatives for approval which may lead to no adjustment to the Contract Sum if the proposed alternative is of similar type and standard and of comparable quality and price to those specified, or lead to an Architect instruction for a Variation to adjust. This clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">applies to materials or goods becoming not procurable</mark>, but does not cover other cases, though the principle may be adopted for other cases, but the application and implication must be clearly stated. The clause does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not state whether the Variation price adjustment</mark> should be based on the full or shared part of the cost reduced. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Some negotiation would be required for Variation instruction</mark> to be issued.
	- It may be difficult to distinguish whether AI or written note to approve Contractor's proposal intends to be variation instruction. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">To avoid ambiguity</mark>, the Contract Bills or Specification would usually contain a clause stating that the approval of the Contractor's proposal does not constitute variation.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Approval considerations</mark>
	- Impact on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">programme</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Quality</mark> concerns
	- Sharing of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost saving</mark>
	- Technical and financial <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">implications on affected elements</mark> not being a subject of the Contractor's proposal change but possibly affect by it
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design responsibility</mark> of the construction elements involved in the Contractor's proposed change
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Professional indemnity</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cost-effectiveness on a whole-life basis</mark>
	- Other considerations such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">environmental and aesthetical</mark> impacts
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Undertakings and warranties</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Accepting the change</mark>
	- If, normally, by some clauses in the Contract Bills or Specification, the approval of a Contractor's proposal will not constitute a variation, the Contractor would assume that the Contract Sum will not be reduced because the alternative proposal is cheaper.
	- Without or without those clauses, a simple approval of the Contractor's proposal change would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not constitute a variation if no documented by means of AI</mark>.
	- The Architect knowing that there would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">substantial cost saving</mark> the Contractor should not simply approve the Contractor's approval but should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not simply approve the Contractor's approval but should treat the change as a variation to be authorized by AI</mark>.
	- There should be some <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">negotiation</mark> as to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">how the cost saving should be enjoyed or shared</mark>, and some understanding as to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time and other effects</mark> taking into account the consideration above before issuing the AI. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI</mark> does not need counter-signature by Contractor. To document that the content is based on mutual agreement, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separate note documenting the mutual agreement</mark> should be signed by Contractor and Employer / Architect on the Employer's behalf.
	- SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(6) substantial change</mark>


### Contractor's proposed drill not as spec *(2022 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">H-size drilling in lieu of N-size drilling</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Without prior approval</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification</mark> clearly states to use N-size drill "unless otherwise stated in the Drawings or instructed by the Engineer"
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Without Engineer's instruction</mark>, Contractor <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shall not change</mark> the drilling from N-size to H-size for drilling through rock at his own discretion. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Whether the sample is acceptable or not is irrelevant</mark> to the principle of remeasurement for the final account. There shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be additional cost payable for non-conforming</mark> work accepted without rectification. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the cost is less, the acceptance without rectification may require price reduction</mark>.
		- SFBC clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">17.3(5)</mark> expressly provides for price reduction. Price reduction can be put forward as a condition of accepting non-conforming work.
		- The draft final account shall be revised to measure those H-size quantities as N-size which should have been done as N-size especially when the rate for N-size is lower
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">With prior approval</mark>
		- If the Contractor had sought the Engineer's approval prior to any field works, the work was authorised beforehand. If there was no clear agreement at the time of approving the Contractor's proposal, there can be argument over whether this should be treated as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">acceptance of the Contractor's proposal without cost effect</mark> or as an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer's instruction with cost effect</mark>.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that he was only <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seeking a clarification instruction</mark> from the Engineer without any intent of putting forward a Contractor's proposal
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification</mark> clauses are qualified by the words "normally" and "unless otherwise instructed by Engineer". This implies that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">choice between H-size and N-size can be decided by Engineer</mark>. This would be particularly so when the Contract is a remeasurement contract.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Engineer may argue</mark> that it was Contractor who proposed first, he was only <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approving the Contractor's proposal without any intent to give higher price</mark> particularly when H-size is more expensive. 
		- It may be possible that when the Engineer approved, he was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not aware of the higher rate for H-size</mark>. He raised argument now only because N-size has been priced cheaper than H-size. Had H-size been priced cheaper, no argument would be raised. It is not reasonable to choose the more favourable option after the event. Had the Engineer been aware of the higher rate, he should have dealt with the matter at the time of the approval.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A reasonable conclusion should be based on true intent with proof.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Measuring "extra over"</mark>
		- BQ item 1.07 is for drilling through soil in N-size, while item 1.09 is for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra cost of that portion</mark> in rock out of the total length in item 1.07. These are clearly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">two different items and priced</mark>. Without the extra over item, the rate for item 1.07 should be the average of drilling though various materials. With the presence of the extra over item, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the rate for item 1.07 shall no be deemed to include the extra cost in rock</mark>. Whether the two items should have the same <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remeasured quantities should be double-checked</mark>. If the drilling started from exposed rock surfaces, both quantities can be the same, otherwise, the draft final account should be revised.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Point of termination of drillholes</mark>
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual quantities</mark> required for ground investigation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">depend greatly on the ground conditions encountered</mark>. That is why a remeasurement contract is used.
		- What the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification sets out are guidelines</mark> which do not necessarily work out an absolute point of termination. The point of termination depends on the ground condition with practical judgement by the Contractor and the Engineer as well. As the question says, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Engineer is satisfied that the point of termination is within the acceptable range of tolerance</mark>. It shall be regarded as a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valid information for remeasurement</mark>.

### Contractor proposed to use robot *(2023 D2Q2a)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">A. RAI regarding bricklaying robot</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whether to respond</mark>
		- Under <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC 2005 clause 1.11(1) or SFBC 2006 clause 1.12</mark>, Employer, Contractor, Architect and QS shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">act reasonably and expeditiously</mark> in all matters under the Contract including without limitation, giving or withholding consent, approval or agreement, valuing Variations and certifying. It is therefore contractually acceptable for the Contractor to ask for the Architect's response by raising his request, and Architect shall respond within a reasonable time frame.
		- Under SFBC <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">clause 4.2(1)</mark>, Contractor has the right to confirm in writing the Architect's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">oral instruction</mark> requiring Variation, and if the Architect does not dissent within 7 days, the Variation shall be deemed to be valid, and the Architect should still issue a written instruction for record purposes. Therefore, Architect's explicit response if essential for good and proper contract administration.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whether response must be AI</mark>
		- SFBC clause 4 stipulates the issue of Architect's instructions. It does not require it to be in any particular <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">format</mark> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">so long as it is in writing</mark>.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Not all types of responses shall be in the form of AI</mark>. Architect's response can be given in different forms depending on the nature of the response and any pre-agreement with the project team with the aim of proper daily contract administration. It should be mindful <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not to abuse the function of documents</mark> like site memo, email, letter, web-based notification and other common communication forms by incorporating "instructions" that should be in the form of AI.
		- Under <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">clause 1.6</mark>, Variation is defined as a change instructed by Architect to the design, quality or quantity of the Works. SFBC clause <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">13.1</mark> requires an AI to be issued for a Variation. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">an AI does not necessarily involve a Variation</mark>.
		- While SFBC do not have such a clause, it is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">usual for the Preliminaries to contain</mark> a clause saying "Any proposal made by the Contractor and approved by the Architect shall <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">be deemed to have no cost or time effect</mark> on the Contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unless</mark> the Contractor expressly states that there should be cost or time effect when submitting the proposal and the Architect confirms in writing to treat this proposal as a Variation when accepting the proposal."
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Assuming</mark> that the present Contract does <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">not contain</mark> this Preliminaries clause, the use of bricklaying robot was proposed by Contractor and was <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not a change instructed by Architect</mark>, so it does not constitute a Variation even though there may be benefits to the Employer.
		- As the Contractor has changed his method of working and the use of robot has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not been anticipated in the Specification</mark>, it is prudent or even <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">necessary for the Contractor to seek Architect's approval</mark> of the use of robot. The Architect should therefore respond to the proposal.
		- As the Contractor is expecting additional payment for the use of bricklaying robot, the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Architect may respond</mark> that the approval is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to no additional cost or time to the Contract</mark>. It will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">up to the Contractor to proceed with the proposal or not</mark>. There should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be a need for reply to be in the form of AI</mark>, however, since an <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">AI does not automatically involve a Variation</mark>, use of an AI is still permissible but for the avoidance of doubt, the AI should say beyond doubt that it is approving the Contractor's proposal without cost or time effect.
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If Contractor does not proceed</mark> with the proposal in view of no cost or time effect, but the Architect and Employer consider that the proposal is desirable, they may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">agree</mark> the cost or time effect with the Contractor and record the agreement in writing in the form of AI.
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whether advantages justify Variation</mark>
		- The main advantages as suggested by Contractor and agreed by the Architect are time saving in constructing brick walls, enhanced site safety and reduced defects. Reducing defects mainly benefits the Contractor. Enhanced site safety would benefit Contractor but also the Employer against the risks of accidents arising. Time saving mainly benefits the Contractor unless the saving in time can be shared with the Employer. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If there are benefits which can be shared with the Employer in a definite manner</mark>, then it would be reasonable to agree some compensation towards the amount quoted, and treat the changes as an acceptance of Contractor's proposal with cost or time effects. Such an agreement should be recorded in writing, the form can be flexible but preferably by AI.

### Basis of VO Measurement *(2021 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Drawing basis</mark>
	- Measurement should be based on the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">tender drawings and the instruction drawings</mark> as that they are common <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">basis</mark> in terms of the levels of details
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Shop / installation dwg</mark> are prepared by the subcon based on the tender dwg and instruction dwg <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">for installation purpose</mark> and may contain more location information as compared to those dwg, or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">different routing to suit the site</mark> conditions at the discretion or risks of the subcon, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not measurable</mark> according to the method of measurement applicable to the Sub-Contract, and therefore cannot be used as the basis of measurement
	- However, the tender dwg and instruction dwg may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be sufficient</mark> enough to show the lengths of ducts, pipes, conduits and wiring to enable accurate measurement. In such cases, the shop / installation dwg may need to be referred to for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">supplement</mark>, but the same interpretation should be adopted for measuring omissions and additions
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">As-built dwg</mark> reflect the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual as-built conditions</mark> which may have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deviations</mark> from the tender dwg / instruction dwg/ shop dwg, and should therefore <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be used for measurement except when it is necessary to supplement</mark> the inadequacy of those drawings, but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unauthorized work is to be excluded</mark>
	- Similar to the as-built drawings, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">site measurement</mark> should also not be adopted. Furthermore, because it can only enable measurement of the ad-built situation and may not enable measurement of the original situation before change. It should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only be adopted when mutually agreed or for daywork or for abortive work</mark>.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Method of measurement</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Same method of measurement stated in Sub-Contract</mark> should be used.
	- However, when a SOR is prepared by Sub-Contractor, the Sub-Contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">usually specifies that any missing</mark> measurement shall be deemed to have been included for in other rates and prices and cannot be measured separately anymore (if the proportion of the work missing original measurement has been significantly changed due to variations, this may be a subject for special claim)
	- With or without express method of measurement, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Sub-Contract may also state that the work shall be measured net as fixed in place</mark>
	- Subject to the foregoing, the same method of measurement used when measuring SOR should be used. This method may need to be inferred from the SOR
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Item to be added apart from dwg</mark>
	- Items which are described in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification</mark> and measurable according to method of measurement applicable to the Sub-Contract
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Abortive work</mark> and ordering due to the variations
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Site overhead</mark> for design coordination, shop drawing submission, testing, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prelim items</mark>, etc due to special and significant changes (Sub-Contractor can price for them separately in the prelim or in the measured works section by inserting items in SOR or allow for the costs in the unit rates. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lump sums are generally regarded as allowances not to be adjusted</mark>. If the costs are included in the unit rates, they are not to be measured separately. However, in case of excessive omissions resulting in the costs included in the unit rates for the balance of the works not adequate to cover the costs, the loss should be included in the valuation. If there are special and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">significant</mark> increase of the services due to variations, the extra costs should also be included in the valuation)
	- Other <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">direct loss and expense</mark> due to variations
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whether complete remeasurement</mark>
	- If the complete measurement is meant to use the total value of the such remeasured qty to replace the original Sub-Contract value, then this is not acceptable. This is because there may be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">under or over measurements</mark> in the original Sub-Contract value, which shall be deemed to have been accepted by both parties and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shall not be corrected</mark>. Such remeasurement will mean the lump sum contract will effectively be changed to a remeasurement contract, and the under or over measurements will take no effect anymore.
	- If the complete measurement is done twice, once based on the tender drawings and once based on the mutually agreed set of instruction drawings or other drawings, both based on the same method of measurement used in preparing the SOR, and if the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost effects are presented in the form</mark> of {original sub-contract sum - value of remeasurement of tender drawings + value of final remeasurement}, then it is acceptable because the adjustment is only for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">net cost effect of the variations without disturbing the under or over measurements in SOR</mark>

### Qty increase but rate too low *(2000 Q4.1)*

- MC's argument
	-  Rate adjustments to be made because of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">excessively extra quantities</mark> should no longer be considered as work under "similar character or executed under similar conditions"
	- Different <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">working sequence</mark>
	- More <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preparation work </mark>on slope
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Disruption costs</mark> arising because work on critical path and extra quantities require longer time
	- Need to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accelerate</mark>
	- The context of the court decision is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not applicable to the present case</mark>
- Employer's argument
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Henry Boot case</mark> shows that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contract is sacred and not subject to correction</mark>. The work <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">condition is not dissimilar</mark>, and whether the price is considered too high or low is immaterial.
- QS's consideration
	- Legal position
		- Rate in BQ is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">bound</mark>, even if it is unrealistically high or low
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reasonableness of rate is irrelevant</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Accept the risk</mark> of that risk being used for valuation, unless substantial change
	- Permissible circumstances
		- The unit rates are really <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inadequate to cover costs</mark>
		- Increased quantities will cause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss</mark> to the Contractor beyond his reasonable contemplation
		- The Contractor should only be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expected to bear</mark> the consequence of his errors in agreeing the Contract Sum, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">but not the consequence of excessive variations</mark> beyond the control of the Contractor
		- Reasonable and prompt settlement will not <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">defer</mark> the work which is on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">critical path</mark>
		- Practical and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable to accept a re-rate</mark>
	- Insurance arrangement

### 15% markup on every tier *(2003 Q4.3) (2015 D2Q4)*

- The 15% mark-up for profit and overhead is usually regarded as an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">industry norm</mark> without contest. 
- It is probably originated from a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">provision in SFBC 2005</mark> which allows 15% mark-up on daywork labour, materials and plant, which is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only applicable to variations valued on daywork basis</mark> and the markup should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">on the direct costs</mark> of labour, materials and plant, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not on sub-contractor's price</mark>.
- However, C would usually treat this as a mark-up over every tier of sub-contracting. This would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">end up in this case with 32.25% mark-up</mark> on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant, which would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">hardly be justifiable</mark> in a competitive market.
- In principle, the level of profit and overheads should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">in line with those used in building up the contract rates</mark>. However, it is usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult</mark> to prove what the level is and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">15% is usually adopted as a convenient norm</mark>. 
- Again, that mark-up is historically to be on the direct costs of labour, materials and plant, but this has ignored the fact that there are usually <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">multi-level sub-contracting</mark>. Each level would need to have some mark-ups for its profits and overheads. It would mean that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">15% would have to be shared</mark> by the Contractor and all levels of sub-contractors. This may not be a problem when daywork is involved because the extent is generally small and the sub-contractor's foremen may count himself as a worker for daywork labour, but may not be in line with reality for normal work. The sub-contractors would also need profit and overheads. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">On the other hand</mark>, since the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">level of overheads service demanded </mark>from the sub-contractors should be smaller than that from the Contractor, their <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mark-ups should be smaller</mark>, and, with the assistance of sub-contractor, the MC's mark-up should also become smaller.
- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable mark-up</mark> level for profit and overheads should be judged based on the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">nature of the work and the prevailing market conditions</mark> rather than raking a stated percentage from a contract clause out of its context.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Unreasonable number of levels of sub-contracting</mark> should not be entertained.

### Markup on every VO *(2017 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Applicable Contract provisions</mark>
	- Both Peter and Contractor's approaches are not entirely correct. The Contract provides a set of valuation rules for various situations, for some of which separate calculation of overheads and profit is allowable. 
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contract rate</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Overheads and profit are deemed to have been included in the contract rates</mark> and prices according to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">HKSMM4</mark>. Items valued using or making reference to the contract rates should therefore have the same allowance for overheads and profit included automatically.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractors are free to allow</mark> for office overheads, site overheads and profit in the unit rates for the relevant measured work or in the preliminaries. Tender Documents <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">usually stipulate that the preliminaries prices are fixed</mark> and would not be adjusted in case of variations to the measured works.
		- Contracts priced based on a set of fixed unit rates and prices usually stipulate that the contract rates should by default be used for pricing increases or decreases in quantities due to variations under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.13.4(1)(a) to (c)(i) & (3)(a)</mark>. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No further mark-up</mark> for overheads and profit is admissible.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Pro-rata rate</mark>
		- If the variation addition is not of the same or similar character to or executed under the same or similar conditions to the original work, then the contract rates should still apply but adjustment can be made for the difference in characters or conditions under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.13.4(1)(a) to (c)(ii)</mark>. Therefore, only if the Contractor can demonstrate that the variation addition has caused him extra overheads <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">over those reasonably anticipated at the time of tendering</mark>, then there can be additions for the extra overheads and related profit. The Contractor should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">substantiate</mark> such additional costs in details rather than apply an arbitrary mark-up percentage.
		- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">happenings cited</mark> by the Contractors can apply to all variations, are therefore <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">normal</mark>, and should therefore have been allowed for in the contract rates.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Fair valuation</mark>
		- Only if, due to different characters or conditions, the contract rates cannot reasonably serve as the base for valuation, then fair rates are to be used under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.13.4(1)(c)(iii)</mark>
		- Fair rates derived from the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">first principles (cost plus overheads and profit)</mark> can take into account all reasonable costs (including<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> extra site preliminaries</mark>) arising from the carrying out of the variation, and have a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">mark-up percentage to cover overheads and profit</mark>. The overheads can cover head office overheads and site overheads not allowed for in the preliminaries. It would be necessary to scrutinize that the site overheads allowed for in the mark-up do not overlap the site overheads allowed for in the costs. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">15% is taken as the common norm for simplicity sake only</mark>. The Contractor may be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">demonstrate that the percentage is the same as that used to price his contract rates</mark>, to follow the principle that the price levels of the contract rates should still be applicable.
		- If the fair rates are determined by making <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reference to market rates</mark>, those rates should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">already have included for overheads and profit</mark>. Care should be taken when deciding whether further mark-up for the same would be made.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Daywork basis</mark>
		- If the variation work cannot be properly measured and valued, it can be valued on daywork basis under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.13.4(2)</mark>. The principle is the same as that described above for fair rates derived from the first principles. SFBC cl.13.4(2)(d)(iv) stipulates that the percentage for overheads and profit should be that included in the Contract, otherwise 15%.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Proper course of actions</mark>
	- Give <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract provisions and contractual interpretations</mark> to Contract for his reference
	- Request the Contractor, if he still disagrees, to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">explain</mark> in more details the contract provisions on which his claim for such mark-up is based
	- Request the Contractor to submit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">proof or record to substantiate that extra site overheads</mark> or head office overheads over the normal anticipation will be or have been incurred.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Review the assessment</mark> of the Contractor's claim in light of the above-mentioned
	- Request the Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">demonstrate the percentage</mark> mark-up for overheads and profit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">used in pricing his tender</mark>. Request where necessary for a copy of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">audited accounts for the past 4 years to counter-check</mark> the head office overheads and profit percentages.


### VO pro-rata rate *(2008 Q2.3)*

### Comment on VO quotation *(2016 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Preamble deemed to include all heights</mark>
	- Preambles only refer to those provided in the original contract, any change shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variation</mark>.
	- BQ of 1100m2 ceilings comprise 500m2 at 6m high and 600m2 at 8m high. Because of different height, the costs of scaffolding, working platform, suspension system, and installation are all different for the two ceilings. The contract rate if <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">$1000/m2 is only an average rate</mark>, being = (500m2 @ rate6 + 600m2 @ rate8)
	- SFBC 2005 <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(1)(ii)</mark> permits that if due to variations, the work affected is no longer carried out under the same or similar conditions, its contract rate can be reasonably adjusted. Therefore, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adjustment of unit rate to the order of rate8 is reasonable and permissible</mark>.
	- Contractor is now <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quoting $2000/m2</mark> which is equivalent to rate8, putting it back to the original quotation would mean rate6 = -200/m2, which is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">absurd</mark>. The Contractor should be requested to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarify and correct</mark> as appropriate.
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">suspension system is heavy steel frame</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">it is likely that rate8 would be cheaper</mark> than rate6 because the savings in the suspension system may be more than the cost increase to the scaffolding.
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">suspension system is light hanger rods</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">it is likely rate8 would be more expensive.
</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VO using daywork rate done by general labourers always on site</mark>
	- The Contractor is primarily <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">entitled</mark> to additional payment for work not originally included in the Contract.
	- If there are contract rates, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates</mark> should be used. There are contract rates in the form of daywork rates. The daywork rates are reasonable applicable to the present case of labour only work, and should be used. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Whether the daywork rates are very profitable or not is immaterial</mark>.
	- If there are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no contract rates</mark>, the rates payable should be on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fair market rates</mark>.
	- Whether daywork rates or fair market rates are to be used, the possible fact that the Contractor does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not really have to spend extra money</mark> to use the general labour routinely standing-by is also <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">immaterial</mark>. Objectively, spending time on moving the furniture would result in a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss of time on other work</mark> - a case of loss without expense.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VO quotation have extra items</mark>
	- Variation should be measured according to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">same standard method of measurement</mark> used to measure BQ. It should therefor be checked to see whether this is the case:
		- Pipe bends - Under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">HKSMM</mark> clause XVII(d)2, deemed to be included
		- Insulation to pipe - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Normally</mark> not required for cold water supply pipes, but may be required to avoid condensation water. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">To be confirmed by A / E</mark>
		- Painting to pipe - Labelling is required. Painting may be required for exposed pipes. Pipes inside pipe ducts and above suspended ceiling is normally not painted. To be confirmed by A / E
		- Connection of pipe to water pump - Under HKSMM clause XVII(d)1, deemed to be included
		- Spares for pipe fittings - Pipe fittings are readily available in the market. The Contractor is normally not required in the Contract to purchase spares and hand them over to Employer. To be confirmed by A / E

## Good Practice

        - Receipt / invoice instead of purchase order
        - Check if quotations submitted by Contractor in order, obtain alternative quotation to verify if necessary
    - Obtain alternative quotation to verify if it is a competitive market price
	    - 3 quotes from separate contractors
    - Check star rate build up
    - Ensure overhead & profit not included twice, normally 15% or less
    - Obliged only to reimburse at market rate not paid price unless special situation
- Daywork
    - Prior consent of Archi on the daywork basis valuation, notice 7 days before the work
    - Request daywork sheet and other verified labour record
    - Verification of daywork sheet by COW or Archi
	    - QS has no power to alter hours if considers excessive on a signed dayworks sheet
    - Seek technical advice from A / E if need
    - Check claimed plant items against Contractor's monthly record of plant on site, and verify with COW
    - Check claimed labour rates against CSD
- Abortive work
    - Must be correctly recorded and approved by Archi
    - Abortive materials must be handed back to Client
    - Less Credit Value if any
- Loss and expense
	- Valid or not
	- Whether reimbursed elsewhere
- Items claimed for small quantities
	- Contractor must be able to demonstrate that BQ rate is not applicable
- Additional Prelim
	- Usually lump sum not adjustable unless significant change
	- General cleaning, removal of debris, protection work, scaffolding
	- Increase of insurance and site security coverage, e.g. outside site boundary
	- Ensure no duplication elsewhere
	- Only when variation requires additional scope of preliminaries items
- Risk items
    - If allow for risk items, need to pay even if the event allowed for never actually happens (e.g. allow for exc. In rock)
    - If provisional quantity, pay based on actual work done
    - Contractor deemed to have accepted the risks and bear the cost; reasonably foreseeable at the time of tendering

### Late instruction before / after completion *(2008 Q2.4)*

- i. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Immediately issue AI</mark>
	- If the wallpaper work is to be instructed before Contract Completion, since the delivery of the selected wallpaper will take two months after placing the order and another month for installation, it will certainly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay</mark> the completion of the works.
	- On the basis that there has been no other delay to the Contract so far, instructing the wallpaper work now would affect the completion of the works, which would constitute as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late instruction</mark> and would entitle the Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark>; and also associated <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss and/or expense</mark> due to prolonging the Contract period.
	- If the completion of the wallpaper is essential to the Employer's business operations, it would be prudent to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advise the Employer</mark> to negotiate and obtain the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prior agreement</mark> on both the time and cost implications before proceeding with the work. The implications may include arranging to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expedite</mark> the delivery of the wallpaper by air-freight or sourcing local stocks, implementing acceleration measures and adding extra labour resources in the installation works, etc.
	- This arrangement will allow the replacement of the wallpaper be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">completed prior</mark> to completion of the whole of the works, and will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">less disruptive </mark>to Employer after handover of the completed works.
- ii. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Instruct to carry out after completion</mark>
	- Unless expressly provide in the Contract, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor is not obliged</mark> to carry out works after completion. The Architect may issue an instruction before completion but <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">treat the works as outstanding works</mark>.
	- Works carried out after completion may adopt <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">market rates</mark> in valuing the works, and he is not bound to adopt the contract rates. The valuation of the works shall include re-rating of any supervision works, protection works, temporary works, labour rates, cost for working out of sequence, etc.
	- Although the time required to complete the outstanding works is subject to agreement between the parties, but the Contractor is not bound by the non-completion clauses in the contract. Therefore, the Employer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cannot impose LAD</mark> on the Contractor in case of a further delay in completing the wallpaper works occurs.
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">magnitude</mark> of wallpaper work is extensive, the Employer should be advised to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enter into SA</mark> with Contractor. The SA should cover all contractual implications arising from the implementation of the variation works after completion.
	- The use of SA may, in principle, be a better arrangement. However, quite often the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">time</mark> and effort taken by the parties to prepare and agree the SA will not make this arrangement worthwhile.
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">magnitude</mark> of the wallpaper work is less extensive, it would be more practical to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">obtain Contractor's agreement</mark> on the time and cost implications before carrying out the works after completion.

### Change after placing order *(2012 D2Q4)*

- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">variation</mark> can be summarized as follows:
	- Omit skirting tikes
		- Omit skirting tile (m) @ contract rate
		- Add brown colour tiles of the same are (m2) @ contract rate
	- Add band tile
		- Add band tile (m) @ pro-rata from contract rate for skirting tile taking into account of additional cutting cost and wastage, and difference in labour cost laying
		- Omit brown colour tile of the same area (m2) @ contract rate
		- Add extra cost of ordering further band tile (m) @ <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra supply rate due to late ordering with allowance for wastage, profit and overheads</mark>
		- Add extra cost of laying further ordered band tile (m) @ extra laying cost due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">out-of-phase laying</mark> with allowance for profit and overheads
	- Change brown colour tile to special colour tiles
		- Add special colour tile (no/m2) @ fair rate taking into account of out-of-phase laying in isolated area
		- Omit brown colour tiles of the same area (m2) @ contract rate
	- Add extra cost of ordering additional brown colour tiles if the final quantity is more than that already ordered (m2) @ extra supply rate due to late ordering with allowance for profit and overheads
	- Add cost of surplus brown colour tiles ordered if the final quantity is less than that already required (m2) @ actual supply rate
	- Add <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extra cost of setting out</mark>
	- Add <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of modifying the mock-up bathroom already done</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contract provisions for VO & explain</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VO for omission</mark> 
		- Cl.13.4(3), full clause
		- Subject to adjustment for extra cost for late ordering, the contract rate for skirting tiles and brown colour tiles shall determine the valuation of the omission under cl.13.4(3)
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">VO for addition</mark> 
		- Cl.13.4(1), full clause
		- Subject to adjustment for extra cost for late ordering & out-of-phase laying, the valuation rule under cl.13.4(1) shall be followed.
		- For <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">brown colour tile</mark>, since there is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no substantial change of qty or character or conditions</mark>, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates</mark> shall apply by default
		- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Band tiles</mark> are a new item and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fair rates shall apply by default</mark>. Part of band tiles will be cut from the original skirting tiles and part of the band riles will be further ordered and laid later. Two different rates may be applied to these two parts.
		- However, it may be argued that the band tile cut from skirting tiles are quite <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">similar</mark> to the skirting tiles such that the rates should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pro-rata</mark> from the contract rate for skirting tile <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">with adjustment for additional cutting cost and wastage and different in labour cost laying</mark>
		- Those further ordered band tiles will only be laid out-of-phase after completion of all other work in the bathrooms
		- The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">special colour tiles</mark> are also a new item and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fair rates</mark> shall apply. These tiles are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ordered late and will only be laid out-of-phase</mark> after the completion of all other work in the bathrooms
		- For <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">band tile and special colour tile laid out-of-phase</mark>, the following extra costs should be considered when building-up the pro-rata or fair rates or, if found to be more convenient, separately:
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of further ordering the tiles, plus wastage, profit and overheads</mark>
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">marking out to reserve the area</mark> for the out-of-phase work
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">labour and internal transportation cost</mark> due to more visits or smaller batches of transportation
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">protection</mark> of the completed work before laying the further ordered tiles
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Making good of possible damage caused</mark> while laying the further ordered tiles
			- Extra <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cleaning and removal of debris</mark> due to another round of laying
			- Any other extra costs reasonably put forward
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Special Preambles</mark>
		- The Special Preambles clause specified the additional coverage of the rates for tile, slab and sheet finishes to include for laying in colours and patterns as required and approved by Architect and for all cutting and wastage for equal margins.
		- It should however be noted that this should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">only refer to</mark> those colours, patterns, cuttings and waste <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">as required for the original Contract</mark> Works. Any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">additional or changed requirements</mark> of colours, patterns, cutting and waste instructed during the progress of the Works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">shall be treated as a variation</mark> under the Contract.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Abortive material</mark>
		- The net change brown tile will be either an addition or reduction subject to assumption made
		- If the net change in qty is a reduction in surplus ordering, the cost of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">surplus ordering should be compensated at the actual supply rate plus profit and overheads</mark> (cl.13.4.(3)(b))
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Abortive works</mark>
		- As the tiling work in the bathrooms will be commenced around 2 weeks later, the setting out for tiling work based on original design should have been done to certain extent. If the design changes are adopted, the said <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">completed setting out</mark> will be come abortive
		- If design changes are adopted, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">completed tiling work in the bathroom of mock-up</mark> will also be required to be hacked off and re-laid partially according to the new design. A cost compensation may be permitted, depending on the contract provisions of mock-up.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Acceleration and prolongation cost</mark>
		- As the works will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be delayed, there is no cost implication</mark> of acceleration and prolongation unless reasonable argument.
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Disruption costs should have been covered</mark> by above items

### A ask C to catch up delay in site meeting (2017 D2Q4b)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Form of instruction</mark>
	- Instructions from Architect must be issued to Contractor in writing (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.4.2(1)</mark>)
	- Contractor may write to Architect to confirm the Architect's oral instruction within 7 days, but the oral instruction will be effective only if the Architect confirms it or not does not reject it within 7 days (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.4.2(1)</mark>)
	- Architect did request the Contractor to expedite and re-sequence but did not intend to result in additional payment. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">To avoid the Contractor's notice of claim from being treated as a confirmation of oral instruction</mark>, the Architect should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarify and reject the notice of claim within 7 days</mark>, though the Contractor's notice was submitted a week after the minutes and might have just missed the specified confirmation period.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Authority</mark>
	- Architect may issue instructions that he is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">empowered</mark> to issue under the Contract (cl.4.1). Strictly speaking, even if the Architect does not reject confirmation of oral instruction in time, oral instructions given beyond the Architect's authority will not be valid.
	- The Architect is empowered under the Contract to notify the Contractor if, in his opinion, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rate of progress</mark> of the works is too slow to ensure that the works will be completed by the current completion date for any reason which does not entitle the Contractor to EOT (cl.25.5(1)). In essence, there will be no payment to catch up the Contractor's own delay as requested by Architect
	- The Architect is empowered under the Contractor to request Contractor to propose <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">delay recovery measures</mark> with additional payment to reduce delays which are entitled to EOT (cl.26.1). <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">To be effective</mark>, the measures and additional payment must be specifically agreed by the Architect (cl.26.2(2)), and the Architect must issue an instruction to implement after receiving written directions from Employer (cl.26.3(1))
	- In any case, the Contractor's notice did not amount to an express mutual agreement
	- An instruction by the Architect for the Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-sequence the works</mark> may be regarded as a variation (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.1.6</mark>) but the instruction may be subject to the formality described above to be effective
	- In order to avoid potential disputes, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect is recommended to clarify in writing</mark> his intention and intended implications of the oral instructions given in the site meeting.

### Spec waive claim for postpone / addition *(2018 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Spec clause waive claim for postponement v LOA</mark>
	- Bonus: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Spec clause is imprecise</mark>. A date "as stated elsewhere in the Contract" can mean <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a date as stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents</mark> which will become part of the Contract or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a date as to be stated elsewhere in the Contract eventually constituted</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Normally</mark>, this kind of clause would say that the possession date of the site as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">stated elsewhere in the Tender Documents</mark> is for indication only. The date will be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">subject to confirmation</mark> upon the award of the Contract or by means of an Architect's Instruction after the award of the Contract. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">No monetary claim will be entertained if the confirmed date is not later than a certain date</mark>. This would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">give a limited period for the Contractor to take the risk</mark> of a non-definite possession date.
	- The possession date of the site has been <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">confirmed in the Employer's LOA</mark> with no similar stipulation that this is still indicative. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LOA is the concluding document conforming the offer and acceptance process and shall take precedence</mark> over the Particular Specification. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no claim intention</mark> should apply if the actual possession date is within the one month as confirmed in the LOA, but would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not apply to the period beyond</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Employer may argue</mark> that Spec clause is wide enough to refer to the date as stated in LOA as indicative only subject to further adjustment. This argument would appear to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">weak</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that Spec clause is of no effect at all as it intends to override the Conditions of Contract which permit L&E compensation for delayed possession date but <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">CC should take precedence</mark>. The chance of success would depend on express term of CC used. It is common practice to state in Tender Documents some modification to the standard terms of CC. In the absence of express terms in the Contract to deny the effect, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">modification stated in Spec is explicit and cannot be totally ignored</mark>. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no claim period stated in Spec should be valid, when being read in conjunction with the confirmed date as stated in LOA</mark>
	- Contractor may also argue that there is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">no definite period for him to take the risk</mark>. In the absence of a definite period, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tender validity period may serve as a useful limit</mark>. The Contract is supposed to be awarded within the tender validity period for immediate commencement after on or two weeks' notice. The no claim period can reasonably be interpreted as no later than the end of such notice period but not beyond. It is considered that this is the best approach to operate Spec clause.
	- The final defense available to the Contractor would be to see whether the Contract contains provision for him to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">determine</mark> his employment or terminate the Contract if the delay to site possession is exceeding a certain permissible maximum period
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC provision</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cl.5.1</mark> means that CC take precedence over Spec, but LOA takes precedence over CC unless modified later in Appendix upon formal signing of Contract
		- In this circumstance, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">one month stated in LOA is the period of waiver of monetary claim</mark>
		- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.36.1</mark> authorizes Contractor to service notice of default leading to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">determination</mark> of employment if the possession date is delayed by more than 120 days
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Spec clause waive claim for addition of works</mark>
	- It is unimaginable that the Contractor would really agree to carry out additional foundation works with no monetary claim at all. The only <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reasonable interpretation having business sense</mark> is that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">additional work will be measured and valued as a normal variation</mark>. EOT for the additional work will be granted. Only the monetary claim over the above the normal valuation of variation, i.e. loss and expense claims in connection with disruptions and prolongation, are to be considered here.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that the foundation works are of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special nature not belonging to his usual nature of work</mark> or the foundation works are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">outside the scope</mark> of the Superstructure Contract, and therefore, he is not obliged to take up the additional foundation works simply by way of an AI. However, it is normal for Spec to described the scope of the works and optional works. The additional foundation works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">have been specified as possible optional works</mark>, there is no reason to deny the validity of spec clause in this manner.
	- As the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">possession date</mark> was supposed to be available one month after the award of Superstructure Contract, this should serve as a good indication to the Contractor at the time of entering into the Superstructure Contract regarding the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">time required to complete the additional foundation works</mark> if so instructed, and hence <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the period of prolongation in respect of which the waiver of monetary claim should apply</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor may argue</mark> that he had no reason to believe and contemplate that there would not be some progress by FDN after LOA. Therefore, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">period of waiver of monetary claim should be much less than one month</mark>. 
	- The conclusion of the above is that the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">maximum period of waiver</mark> that the Employer can argue for is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">one month after the date of LOA and a reasonable settlement would be a shorter</mark> period to be negotiated. The <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">breaking up and removing of the incorrect footings should not be included in the waiver</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">SFBC provision</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Clause 13.1(1)(c)</mark> authorizes Contractor to refuse to comply with instructions which would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">fundamentally change the scope or nature of the works</mark>. However, as explained above, the additional foundation works should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not fall</mark> into this kind of work
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Differences between two situations (i) and (ii)</mark>
	- As far as the monetary waivers are concerned, the two situations (i) and (ii) are both subject to the same arguments mentioned above. A possible <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">difference</mark> would be that the bankruptcy under situation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">(ii) may happen any time</mark> within or beyond the 6 weeks' periods estimated for situation (i). Stoppage of work due to bankruptcy will <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">require extra time to the conduct survey, to check and record the work done, to take over the incomplete work, to retrieve past inspection records and test certificates, and to rectify any defects found,</mark> not to mention the possible need to put the works out for competitive tendering.

### VO for provide security to E's storage of Direct Contractor's material *(2019 D2Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Provision of standby security guards</mark>
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">instruction is not specific</mark> as to the number of guards to be provided
	- It should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">checked whether there have been subsequent clarification</mark> as to the number of guards to be provided. The clarified staffing requirements should be used for the variations.
	- If there have been no clarifications, then the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">relevant facts and the reasonableness</mark> of providing the standby guards should be checked
	- Any full-time guard would need to take meal beaks, go to toilet, take statutory holidays, take sick leaves, takes casual leaves, leave the place for other emergency causes, etc. It is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable that two guards or a standby guard is required for a shift</mark>
	- If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">storage yard is big or there is more than one access or there are insufficient physical security measures</mark>, it is reasonable to provide more than one guard at any time
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">actual duty time</mark> of the day and night shifts and the principal and standby guards should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clarified and substantiated</mark> by attendance records and payroll records to see how the standby guards' times interacted with the principal guards' time, and to see whether the daily rates should be the same for the principal guards and standby guards.
	- Contract rates have been used. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">applicability of the contract rates</mark> should be reviewed
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Use of star rates after contract completion date</mark>
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(1)</mark> , <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates</mark> should be used for valuation of variation of similar character executed under similar physical working conditions. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If the character is similar but the conditions are changed</mark>, the contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rates should be adjusted</mark> for the difference in the conditions
	- On the other hand, the contract rates are for work executed on the contract site and are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not binding for unanticipated work outside the site</mark> whether or not of similar working conditions. The provision of the security guards outside site is outside scope of works especially when the equipment is not for use in the Contract nor entirely for use under this project, the contract rates are not binding
	- Putting aside the question of binding or not, the temporary storage yard is very remote from the contract site. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">working conditions at the temporary storage yard can be very different</mark> from those on the contract site making it unfair to use the contract rates as the base for adjustment. The Contractor is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">entitled to ask for star rates</mark> instead of contract rates or adjusted contract rates
	- Furthermore, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">contract rates are for work carried out within the original contract period</mark>. If a piece of contract work or variation is required to be carried out after the original contract period due to reasons for which the Employer is responsible, Contractor is entitled to ask for an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adjustment to the contract rates or claim loss and expense</mark> under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl. 27.1</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Even if the contract rats were originally reasonable</mark>, possible reasons for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost increase</mark> are: wage increase from the middle of the original applicable period to the period after original completion date, change of guards or security company, etc.
	- In summary, Contractor can ask for star rate throughout
	- Bonus: strangely, Contractor has <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">used some contract rates for valuing the days before original completion</mark> date without asking for star rates or adjusted contract rates, but only asked for star rates after original completion date. It may be possible that the quoted contract rates are not for work of the same description but are those which have already <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">accounted for the change in working conditions</mark> for days not later than original contract date. In that case, both the reasonableness of the quoted contract rates and the star rates should be examined.
	- Bonus: if may also be possible that the quoted contract rates have not already accounted for the change in working conditions for days not later than original completion date but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor is prepared to be bound by them</mark> and only wants to ask for star rates for the days after. In that case, the reasonableness of star rates should be examined.
	- When contract rates or star rates have been used, there should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no reasons to add another 15% mark-up</mark> for overheads and profit at the end. When star rates have been used, examination of the same is required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">see if profit and overheads have been included</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Payment for security guards deployed during different delayed periods</mark>
	- Along with the delayed completion, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor had no choice but to continue </mark>with the provision of security guards until the completion of the works in order to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">comply with AI</mark>. The real question to address is whether Contractor is entitled to payment for the different delayed period
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Excusable delay</mark> - the addition of signal cable is a variation entitling to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">L&E compensation</mark>, so there should no be any disagreement as to whether payment for guards for the 20 days' EOT should be made. However, instead of invoking the L&E clause, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">VO should take in account the full impact of EOT</mark>. (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(c)</mark>)
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Culpable delay</mark> - generally, there should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no L&E compensation</mark> for prolonged period due tot he Contractor's own delay. It may therefore be argued that Contractor should not be entitled to payment for the 40 days' culpable delay.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">L&E compensation</mark> generally refers to compensation of loss and expense due to causes over and above the r<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">isks for which the Contractor should have the opportunity to allow for in the Contract Sum</mark>. If the risks belong to the Contractor, no L&E compensation will be made. There would be no L&E compensation in respect of the provision of guards on site which is a contract work.
	- However, the need to provide additional <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">guards outside the site is not within the scope</mark> of original Contract. The Contractor could not have allowed for the risks of the his own delay sin respect of the guards outside site in the Contract Sum. The instruction did not specify a fixed period, it should have reasonably expected that the period is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">floating</mark> and Contractor would be expecting payment for floating period. If the instruction did specify a fixed period, EOT of fixed period would need another instruction 
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If it is expressly stated</mark> that in the original or additional instruction that any extended guarding period due to the Contractor's fault should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">borne by Contractor</mark>, the Contractor will likely follow the argument for star rates above that the instruction is beyond the scope of the works and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">can be refused</mark>. 

### Consideration for material change VO *(2022 D2Q2)*

- It should be noted that the all-in rate for the new stone estimated by the assistant is by adding the difference between the two FOB rates to the contract rate. This is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">inappropriate because</mark> the two types of stones have different sizes, thickness, weights, base supply costs, times of ordering / fabrication / installation, exchange rates, etc which will result in different supply and fabrication on-costs, fixing costs, and the overall mark-up for profit and overheads
- The simplest <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approach</mark> would be to omit the original all-in price for the original stone, then add the abortive costs of the supply of the original stone and the all-in price for the new stone
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">abortive costs of the supply</mark> can be based on the current estimate of the actual costs of supply without cancellation
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">abortive materials</mark> if fully paid by the Employer shall become the property of the Employer and the abortive costs should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">include the storage costs and costs of delivery to the Employer's chosen places</mark>
- The two batches may be re-sold or re-used elsewhere or disposed of. The 2nd batch may be cancelled subject to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cancellation charges</mark>. It would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be possible to estimate the credit value</mark> by tomorrow. Either the cost estimate should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remain silent on this point (until the Employer asks) or a note be stated of such possibility</mark>.
- Since this is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost estimate</mark>, it should be sufficient. The all-in rate for the supply and fix of the new stone should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">based on the current costs of supply and fix plus profit and overheads</mark>. Whether the original price levels should be kept unchanged should be something to be dealt with when actually agreeing the variation.
- The following <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"add-on" items</mark> shall be added to the FOB cost to give the full supply and fabrication cost:
	- Allowance for cutting and installation <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">wastage</mark>
	- Shipping <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery</mark> from the port to the fabrication yard
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Fabrication</mark> (usually cutting the stone slab to size and surface treatment)
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delivery</mark> from the fabrication yard to the site in Hong Kong
	- Off-sit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">storage</mark> (if required)
	- Import <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tax</mark> and VAT
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost of fixing</mark> the new stone may increase due to changed sizes, thickness and weight of stone. Dry fixing method may be required. If the stone has special stone pattern, this will also increase the fixing cost.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Additional design work</mark> e.g. preparation of revised shop drawings, coordination with other trades etc should be included
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mark-up for Contractor's profit and overheads</mark> to arrive at the all-in rate
- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">potential cost implication to other fittings</mark> e.g. vanity counters, mirror cabinets due to the change in details of interface, or a statement that such costs are excluded
- An estimate of the loss and expense claim due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">prolongation</mark> of the overall construction period. It should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clearly stated that this is just an estimate</mark>.

### Comment on additional payment claim *(2023 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">A. Tile not shown on elevation</mark>
	- Finishes schedule has specified the wall finishes to the main entrance lobby. Although the elevation of the dead-end wall has not been shown on the Contract Drawings, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasonable expect</mark> that the wall finishes should be applied to all the wall surfaces of relevant room without the need to show all the elevations. In fact, the Contract Drawings also have not shown all the elevations for all the rooms, and have not shown other wall finishes to the dead-end wall. An <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">average competent contractor can estimate</mark> the quantities showing the design intent. Therefore, it is considered that the Contractor's argument is not valid
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">If the Contractor does not agree</mark> with the above interpretation, he should follow SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 28</mark> requirements for any additional payment. The NOC must be submitted within 28 days of it becoming apparent to the Contractor that an event has occurred which gives rise to a claim, and he shall include in the notice the contractual provisions upon which the claim is based. According to clause 28.3, the Contractor must comply with the time frame and procedures stated in clause 28.1 and 28.2, otherwise, the claim will be deemed to have been waived by the Contractor. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Such a clause is not applicable to valid variations</mark>. Normally, quotations and revised quotations are submitted for variations for agreement with QS without the need to escalate to a claims. 
	- Bonus: Clause 28 does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not define the time "when an event has occurred"</mark>, it may be argued that the event time is not the time of carrying out the alleged variation but the time of disagreement. This will then escape the time restriction specified in clause 28.
	- Bonus: Some Candidates may raise the importance of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">checking other parts</mark> of the Contract, e.g. tender correspondence, specification, that may contain clarification on the finishes requirements
	- Bonus: Seek further <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">advice from Architect</mark> on the interpretation of the design intent in determining the Contractor's entitlement to additional payment
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">B. Equivalent material not approved</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect shall determine</mark> whether the minor difference in the technical data is so important that it will cause noticeable impact on the performance of the ceramic tiles. 
	- It is believed that products of different brands are carrying some variance in the technical data to certain extent. If the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">variance stays within the range of tolerance</mark>, the Contractor's proposed brand "s" should be considered as "<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">equivalent</mark>" under the Contract. The fact that the contract <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">specification is actually based on the technical data of brand "X"</mark> is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">irrelevant</mark> because this has not been notified in the tender documents. The contract specification should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">interpreted according to the standard of the average competent person</mark> of the same calling. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Using brand "S"</mark> as proposed by the Contractor as an acceptable equivalent should not constitute a Variation. If the minor difference should objectively be accepted, but the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect insists on using brand "X"</mark>, it shall be instructed as Variation. The valuation of this Variation is basically the delta between the market prices of brand "S" and brand "X" plus related profit and overheads. 
	- Clause 28 notice of claim for additional payment is not required for Variation.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">C. Different setting out starting point</mark>
	- The elevation drawings have specified the setting out requirements, it is reasonable for the Contractor to allow for the tile wastage based on the Contract Drawings' setting out. Any revision to the setting out drawings affecting the wastage of tiles should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">entitle</mark> the Contractor to additional payment. 
	- Some Candidates may refer to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">preambles</mark> which typically say that the rates shall include for different types of fixing methods or "laid in pattern". However, it does not mean that the rates should cover any types of fixing methods
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If there are no express methods</mark> shown in the Contract Drawings or Specification, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">methods commonly adopted</mark> should be argued for.
	- However, since the Contract Drawings have expressly shown the fixing method, the rates should be deemed to cover the shown method only. The Contractor shall show the difference in wastage due to the different fixing methods.
	- NOC is not required for Variation.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">D. Extra labour cost for change cement grout to expoxy grout</mark>
	- For the change of cement grout to epoxy grout instruction, firstly, it is necessary to establish if the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's argument</mark> regarding the workmanship and skilled labour is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">correct or not</mark>. It can be resolved by asking the Contractor to substantiate the additional resources incurred. The Consultant QS may make his judgement as a normal part of the rate build-up or in case of doubt, he should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ask Architect's or COW's comments</mark>, the Consultant QS shall then assess the additional amount and add it to the overall assessment.
	- Regarding the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">special bonus</mark> for securing the skilled workers, it should be checked whether the special bonus actually means the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">normal higher pay</mark> for such kind of skilled workers. If it is, the QS can consider in the valuation. However, if it is due to the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">need to accelerate work</mark> to carry out special measures, then the reasons to do so should be justified as due to the direct consequence of this AI before the special bonus is admitted into the valuation. In case of doubt, the QS should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">seek Architect's comments</mark>. 
	- NOC is not required for Variation except for the part disagreed.

### Abortive work *(2020 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Contractor's entitlement to claim abortive work</mark>
	- Strangely, SFBC do not contain the term abortive work. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Abortive work means</mark> something done or purchased has to be changed including demolition and therefore become abortive. 
	- Abortive work on site can be caused by many different <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reasons</mark> such as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late instruction</mark> for design changes after the Contractor has procured the materials or carried out due to variations before ordering materials, the Contractor's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">own fault in deign</mark> for which he is responsible and in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">materials and workmanship</mark>, etc.  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Damage caused by natural events</mark> such as rain, storm, fire, etc can also result in abortive work
		- Certainly, the Contractor is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not entitled to recover</mark> additional cost in carrying out abortive work due to his own fault or due to persons or events for which he is responsible under Contract
		- If the abortive work is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">caused by Employer's fault</mark> or persons or events for which he is responsible under Contract, the Contractor can get compensation
		- If the change leading to abortive work is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">due to instructed variations</mark>, the abortive work should be treated as apart of variation. If the change is caused by damage by the persons or events for which the Employer is responsible, Contractor can require the rectification work to be instructed as a variation
		- An instruction variation addition would entitle Contractor to additional payment as variation under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.3(a)</mark>, EOT for critical delay under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25.1(3)(h)</mark> and related monetary compensation under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.27.1(2)(c)</mark>. Monetary compensation can include profit under SFBC.
		- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">late clarification of ambiguity</mark>, discrepancy or divergence between the Contract Doc and post contract instructions and supplementary information can result in abortive work. This would be treated as a variation
		- Bonus: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">opening up for inspection</mark> of work covered up or testing can result in abortive work. The consequence will depend on who should be liable. There is a specific contract clause to deal with this, and the abortive work is not usually so called.
		- Bonus: apart from treating abortive work as part of variations, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC also have clauses to permit EOT, L&E for events</mark> which may cause abortive work, e.g. force majeure, inclement weather, trophical cyclone, black rainstorm, excepted risks, specified perils, etc.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Procedures</mark>
	- While there can be many valid grounds to claim abortive work, the most important step is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">keep records of abortive work before making changes</mark>
	- Upon receipt of a variation instruction from Architect or the happening of other entitling events likely to result in abortive work, Contractor should <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">immediately check and report</mark> if any abortive work will be incurred due to variation or event, so that Architect can, if possible, revise the design or take other actions to avoid abortive work.
	- If the variation is confirmed by Architect to proceed in spite of abortive work or abortive work has already been caused by some other events which cannot be controlled in advance, a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">joint site inspection</mark> should be conducted with Architect or COW as soon as practicable to record the status of work carried out or completed.
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">joint site inspection records should state clearly</mark> the respective variation instruction number or the description of other entitling events, the date of the inspection, location, description, and extent of affect work completed and work which may become abortive, the description and quantities of abortive materials, if any. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Photos and measurement</mark> should be taken. Videos may also be taken. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">records must be endorsed</mark> by Architect or COW and Contractor immediately for proper records
	- While the site inspection records should serve as a true record, it does not necessarily mean that the abortive work is valid for payment. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">validity of the abortive work should be checked and confirmed with Architect</mark> before inclusion in valuation for payment and final account.
	- Abortive work may often require <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">demolition and alterations</mark>. If the nature of the demolition and alterations is such that the work cannot properly be measured and valued, then valuation on <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">daywork basis</mark> should be adopted, but his would require the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Architect's prior consent, and with record</mark> of labour, materials, and plant spent on the abortive work properly recorded and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">verified by Architect</mark> before inclusion in the valuation for payment and final account under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(2)</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Abortive materials once paid by Employer will become property of the Employer</mark>, and shall therefore be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">identified and stored separately</mark> as directed by Architect. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If Contractor is authorized to sell</mark> abortive materials, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sales value after deducting Contractor's handling charges</mark> should be deducted from future payments and final account
	- If Contractor wants to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">claim EOT or L&E</mark> due to abortive work, he should follow the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">procedures</mark> laid down in Contract to give notices and claims substantiations for Architect and QS to process all as stated in <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.25, 27, 28</mark>.
	- Bonus: prior consent to use daywork and verification of daywork records are required by SFBC. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">In the absence of prior consent or verification, building up of unit rates with the first principle</mark> using genuine time records should also be acceptable.

### Change of law

- No provision in current SFBC
- If A's design infringe law
	- Contractor to comply and notify infringement (cl.6.2(1))
	- AI to resolve, entitle VO (cl.6.2(2))
- If change of law imposes extra requirements
	- Change before tendering closing date
		- Implied condition / statutory requirement to comply
		- No EOT, no L&E
		- Fee on Contractor if not increase afterwards (cl.6.3)
	- Change after tendering closing date
		- Implied condition / statutory requirement to comply
		- EOT, L&E
		- Fee increase reimbursable subject to receipt (cl.6.3)
- Exception
	- Made known to Contractor
	- A reasonable Contractor should have known
		- Reasonably foreseeable to an experienced contractor
	- SCC impose risk of law change on Contractor 
- Rationale
	- Variation of obligation and restriction (cl.1.6)
	- Contractor cannot be expected to price in unknown / unpublished change, unfair to hold full risk
	- Reasonable for Employer to share risk of unforeseen risk of law change
	- Encourage Contractor's compliance with statutory requirement
	- Avoid Contractor's contingency pricing for unforeseeable change of law
- Good practice
	- Include a cut-off date (e.g. 10 days before tender closing) for defining "foreseeable" change
	- Keep records of law changes that might affect construction
	- Highlight coming law changes in tender documents if known to Employer / Consultant
	- Require Contractor to advise if any possible legal changes
	- Request substantiation for EOT and L&E claims for law change
	- Negotiate with tenderer to include law change if change after tendering closing date but before LOA


## Variation for Discrepancies or Error

- Discrepancies between documents (cl. 2.4)
    - Precedence (cl. 5.1)
        - Commercial: Contract Bill
        - Technical: Drawing and Spec
    - Contractor to inform (cl. 2.4)
        - Contractor to inform Architect if he finds ambiguities in documents
        - AI if Architect agrees
        - Variation if considered appropriate
- Errors in Contract Bills (cl. 14.3)
    - Errors not vitiate nor release Contractor from any obligations (cl. 14.3(1))
    - Error in quantity or omission (cl. 14.3 (2))
        - Shall be corrected
        - Deemed to be a Variation for the sole purpose of adjusting the Contract Sum
    - Error in description (cl.14.3(3))
        - Shall be corrected
        - If in QS opinion rate no longer fair, fix a new fair rate

### BQ Error / Dwg Discrepancy / Pro Qty *(2021 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Actual qty done exceeding BQ qty</mark>
	- Check the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">correctness of BQ qty against Contract Dwg and the correctness of the actual qty against instruction dwg</mark> to find out the reasons for the differences
	- VO authorized by AI should be measured, valued and paid for under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.3 & 13.5</mark>
	- BQ error should be deemed to be valid VO for sole purpose of adjusting contract sum under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.14.3(2)</mark>
	- Work done without authorization should not be paid for under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.1(3)</mark>
	- Confirmatory instructions should be issued for work done as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">orally instructed under 4.2(1)</mark> - though there is a risk of being declared too late
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Discrepancies between Contract Drawings</mark>
	- Since there is a discrepancy between Contract Drawings, MC should request A to clarify whether the schedule or the plan or some other new information should be followed by way of AI under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.2.4</mark>
	- If quantity accordingly confirmed is different from BQ qty, this should be treated as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">VO</mark>, part of which may be due to BQ errors depending on whether new information has been used or not
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">No payment for Pro Qty not shown on Contract Drawings</mark>
	- Pro qty can be included in BQ for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">potential work</mark> not shown on Contract Drawings
	- AI is required for the carrying out of work covered by pro qty (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.2</mark>). Therefore, no payment can be made due to no instruction. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If work has actually been done</mark>, MC should ask A to issue AI to authorize, and valuation for the remeasurement of the pro qty can be made for payment purposes under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.3(b)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Top formwork to sloping slab</mark>
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">HKSMM4</mark> Section VII Concrete Works item (d) measurement rule M.10, top formwork is only measured for surfaces sloping exceeding 15 degrees, no matter whether it is provided or not. Hence, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">no top formwork</mark> shall be measured for the sloping RC slab sloping 10 degrees only.
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">HKSMM4</mark> Section VII Concrete Works item (d)2.1.2 under the classification table, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">formwork to sloping soffit</mark> of slab shall be measured separately in BQ, and there is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BQ error</mark>.
	- BQ errors should be deemed to be valid <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">VO under cl.14.3(2)</mark>

### Unforeseen ground condition different from SI report

- Reason of uncertainty even if site investigation
	- Site investigation 
		- Sample only specific points, conditions between boreholes may vary
		- Depth not deep enough to reveal subsurface conditions
		- Human error
	- Natural ground conditions are inherently inconsistent
		- Obstructions not detected
		- Groundwater fluctuations 
	- Underground utilities
		- Incomplete or outdated records
- Whether SI is expressly stated to be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">part of contract document</mark>?
	- Henry Boot: not stated, no entitlement to LE
	- Bacal v Northamption: stated, entitlement to LE
- Whether SI is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">representation</mark>?
	- Henry Boot: not a statement with sufficient definite and unqualified to constitute a representation
	- Howard Marine v A. Ogden: no reasonable ground to believe in the truth of statement, no sufficient reliance
	- Pearson v Dublin: fraud as deliberately know the misrepresentation
- Employer may include a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">non-reliance clause</mark>
	- May fail if Employer considered that the Contractor has relied upon the information provided
- GCC / SP of private job
	- Allocate risk solely to the Contractor
	- "... The Contractor shall be deemed to have visited the site and satisfied himself that he has allowed in his price for everything necessary for the completion of the Works"
- NEC / FIDIC Red Book
	- Risk on Employer
- Common law
	- Unless Contract stated otherwise, Contractor to bear the risk in unforeseen ground conditions whether it was foreseeable or not
	- No implied warranty on the accuracy of information provided by Employer, unless fraudulent misrepresentation (knowingly, without belief in the truth)
- Cons of transferring all risks to Contractor
	- Higher tender prices as the Contractor may include a contingency to deal with the conditions that may arise
	- Unfairness to tenderers allowing high risk for underground conditions
	- Disputes, uncooperative attitude, programme delay
- Recommendation to Employer
	- Take up or share the risks of unforeseeable ground conditions with Contractor in line with the international practice
	- Provide best possible information in tender documents
	- Pre-tender investigation for utilities and ground conditions
	- Update utilities records by latest technology
- Foreseeability

## Variation of Contract

- A change in the contract itself, not originally contemplated by contract terms
    - Cannot alter the nature of the works
    - Cannot instruct Contractor to carry out works in excess of what was envisaged under the contract
- Parties can agree changes to terms of contract
    - Must have consideration unless change made by deed

## Omission of Works

- Omission of works (cl. 13(3))
	- BQ rates determine
	- If incurred expense, fair adjustment (subject to SCC)
		- Loss and expense
		- Abortive works (cl.13.4(3)(b))
	- If substantial change, fair adjustment (cl.13.(6))
- Omission of item with no pricing
	- Cost deemed to have been included elsewhere
	- Unless special arrangement in TQ / LOA
		- Pro-rata rate with reference to similar item
		- Fair rate
- Substantial omission of works
	- Substantial: say 30%
	- Variation of Contract not under Contract
	    - Change the nature and foundation
	- Archi has no power, shall be omitted by Supplementary Agreement
	    - Terms and scope
	    - Both parties' signature
	    - Compensation to Contractor including overhead
- Possible L&E claims for VO omission
	- Prelim / Profit and overhead
		- Preparation of shop drawings
		- Shared fixed cost
	- Works 
		- Cost of work done
		- Demolition to works already done but omitted, and make good
		- Extra cleaning works
	- Material
		- Cost of material payment
		- Cost for cancelling orders for materials
		- Cost for removing off site material delivered
		- LESS credit value
	- Disruption cost for interruption of programme
	- Loss of productivity
	- Remaining works may have higher cost
		- Small quantity for bulk purchase
		- Less repetitive works
		- Insufficient use of plant
	- Loss of profit (claim under law not contract)
		- Especially when omit and give to others
- Contractor's possible ground for objection
	- The work could have entitled Contractor to EOT to set off own delay
	- The work is essential to comply with statutory requirements
	- Employer cannot omit work for it to be carried out by others under common law 
	- Substantial omission changes the nature and foundation of contract
- Adjustment to Contract Sum
	- Omission based on contract rate
	- Fair adjustment if the rates are rendered unreasonable for remaining works (substantial change)
	- Loss and expense
	- Revise LAD, Retention, Surety Bond, insurance
- Omission of work to give it to others
	- Principle
	    - Once a man has contracted to do a certain quantity of work, he has the right to do it if it is to be done at all
	    - The work may be omitted but only if work not to be done at all, not in order to give it to someone else
	- Rationale
		- Avoid the unfairness caused to Contractor if Employer give the work to others with cheaper price
	- Pre-condition
		- Contractor's consent required cl.13.1(1)(b) 
	- Consequence
		- Omit without consent is breach of contract
			- Gallagher v Hirsch: omission means only work not to be done at all
		- Possible additional cost for attendance
		- Contractor entitled to L&E including loss of profit if can prove under common law
		- Abortive work (13.4(3)(b)) and fair adjustment (cl.13.4(6))

### AI for omission *(2016 D2Q3b)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Empowered to omit</mark>
	- The Architect may issue instruction ordering variations which involve omission of work under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.1</mark>.
	- Accordingly, the Architect is empowered to issue instruction to omit the external signage work.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Valuation of variation</mark>
	- The work omitted shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valued based on the contract rate</mark> under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(3)</mark>.
	- Under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(3)(b), a fair adjustment</mark> shall be made to the valuation of the work omitted, if the Contractor has reasonably <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">incurred expense</mark> which has become wholly or partly unnecessary as a result of the omission of work.
	- Under SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(6), a fair adjustment</mark> shall be made to the rates for the remaining work, if the omission of work <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">substantially</mark> changes the conditions under which the remaining work is carried out.
	- Omission of the external signage does not appear to warrant the above adjustment
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor's objection ground</mark>
	- Generally, contractors would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not object to the omission of work unless the work is very profitable</mark>. However, the provisions for fair adjustments mentioned above would not help the contractors in this respect, even when the omission is intentional to avoid the high prices
	- A possible <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ground for objection</mark> is that the external signage work could have entitled the Contractor to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT which can off-set the Contractor's own delay</mark>, but his entitlement will be lost due to the omission. However, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC does not have express provisions</mark> dealing with such situation. The argument would therefore need to be resolved with reference to the common law. In spite of this, there is no reason why the Contractor should not raise his objection with the Architect in order to protect his own interest.
	- Another possible ground for objection to the omission of work is where the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">work is essential to comply with statutory requirements</mark>, e.g. obtaining occupation permits. If this is the case, then it is an act of prevention on the part of the Employer or the Architect. The Contractor can object even if there is no express contract provision for objection.
	- It is a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common law principle that the Employer cannot omit work for it to be carried out by others</mark>. If he does so, he will be liable to pay the Contractor the profit lost because of the omission. The purpose is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">avoid the unfairness</mark> caused to the Contractor if the Employer picks the high price work and gives it to others at a cheaper price making an otherwise profitable job a loss to the Contractor.
		- SFBC <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.1(1)(b)</mark> expressly provides that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Contractor's written consent is required</mark> for an instruction regarding the omission of work in order for it to be carried out by others.
		- The Employer's omission <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">may be genuine one because of budget</mark> constraint after many other variation additions. If he only employs others to carry out the external signage work long after the completion of the  Contract, then it may not be reasonable to apply the above common law principle.

### Omission & give others due to poor performance *(2021 D2Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Slow progress of work</mark>
	- If A considers that the progress is to slow to ensure that the works can be completed by the Completion Date due to the default of MC, he may pursuant to clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">25.5(1) notify</mark> MC accordingly
	- According to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">clause 25.5(2)</mark>, MC may then at its own discretion take measures to expedite the work progress at his own expense
	- Irrespective of whether MC selects to expedite or not, if the works cannot be completed by Completion Date eventually and the Architect issues a certificate to that effect, Employer is entitled to deduct <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">LAD under cl.24.1(1) and 24.2(1)</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Suggestion</mark>
		- Suggestions to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">expedite the progress</mark> should be given without waiting for the instructions, e.g. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">re-sequence of work from sequential to parallel</mark>, arrange <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">overtime</mark> work, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">deploy more labour</mark> on site, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">start Section 2 works earlier</mark> to keep the original Completion Date
		- If Section 2 on time completion is really required by Employer for some special purpose, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">convince</mark> Employer and Architect that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">employment of others to carry out Section 2 works would not be earlier</mark> than if the Contractor starts Section 2 works now.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Poor quality of work</mark>
	- Under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.8.1</mark>, MC must provide materials, goods, workmanship and work of the types, standards and quality described in the contract
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If MC fails to do so, A may instruct</mark> MC to remove the non-compliant materials, goods, workmanship or work from the Site pursuant to clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">8.3(a)</mark> or repair / demolish / remove / re-construct the non-compliant work pursuant to clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">8.3(b), 8.4 and 17.3(1)</mark> at ay time until the end of the DLP, all without conferring on MC a right to additional payment
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Suggestion</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Rectify</mark> the defects and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">improve</mark> the forthcoming work should be given without waiting for the instruction, e.g. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enhance quality control measure, strengthen process management, set up site quality inspection team</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Insufficient workforce on site</mark>
	- MC does <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not have express provision</mark> to deal with smaller workforce than planned. See the above if slow progress or poor quality is resulted
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Suggestion</mark>
		- There can be many reasons for the smaller workforce. MC should reasonably put forward
		- Increase the workforce to suit the programme
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Omission of works</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">None of the above issues would confer a right on Architect to omit</mark> a substantial part of the works as a VO. Therefore, it may be argued that A's reliance on the 3 issues as reasons to omit is without proper basis.
	- Clause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">13.1(1)(b)</mark> requires <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC's written consent</mark> to an instruction omitting work in order for it to be carried out by others. Therefore, A has no right to omit Section 2.
	- In the absence of this express term, under the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">common law</mark>, if the Employer omits work in order for it to be carried out by others, he shall be liable for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loss and expense caused to MC including loss of profit</mark>.
	- For valid omission of work, MC is entitled to compensation of expense which has become wholly or partly unnecessary as a result of the omission under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(3)(b)</mark>, and adjustment to the unit rates for the remaining work if the omission substantially changes the conditions under which the remaining work is carried out, and results in the rates for the remaining work becoming unreasonable or inapplicable (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.13.4(6)</mark>)
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Suggestion</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Raise circumstances where unnecessary expenses</mark> may be incurred or the unit rates for the remaining work may be rendered unreasonable and inapplicable, e.g. Section 2's site are is being or will be used as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">temporary storage area or other site logistics purpose</mark>; the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">supplier and subcon for Section 2 have been committed</mark>

## Agreement of Valuation of Variations

- Start the agreement process during the construction period
- Cost review meeting
	- Set up timetable on the frequency of cost review meeting

### Measure to improve AI & VO *(2023 D2Q2b)*

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">B. Practical measures to control RAI and manage the process efficiently</mark>
	- Submit <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">estimates</mark> (by Contractor or QS) for proposed variations to assist the Employer to decide whether to require the variations or not
	- Issue proper <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AI in writing instead of oral instruction</mark>, site memo or other forms of instructions to reduce the need for Contractor to raise RAI 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Issue AI or VO as soon as possible after the oral instruction</mark>, site memo or similar is given to reduce the need for the Contractor to issue RAI
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Categorise and prioritise the RAI</mark> to respond
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Establish clear procedure and specific time frame</mark>, if not already in the contract, for initiating variations, estimating cost implication, approval and issuance
	- Ensure AI or VO are <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">issued with sufficient and accurate information</mark> for defining scope of variation for execution
	- Agreement <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">standard form</mark> of AI or VO, RAI and other related documents to ensure the information attached to the form is sufficient for valuation
	- Hold <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">regular meetings</mark> preferably on site to clear the backlog, with attendance of the relevant parties. Conduct <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">joint site inspections</mark> if necessary
	- If there is any <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">argument over the validity</mark> of a RAI in particular those with major cost implications, break down the work in the RAI and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">proceed with the valuation of those agreed parts</mark> for interim payment
	- Maintain a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">live master copy</mark> of RAI and AI or VO for access for relevant parties with automatic overdue warning notice
