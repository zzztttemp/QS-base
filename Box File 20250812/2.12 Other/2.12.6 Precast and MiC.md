## Pre-cast Concrete Components

- Building components
	- ![Pasted image 20250708171006|700](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250708171006.png)
- Pros
	- Faster construction: Off-site fabrication reduces on-site time.
	- Better quality control: Factory conditions ensure consistency and precision.
	- Less site disruption, environmental friendly: Minimizes noise, waste, and congestion.
	- Weather-independent: Production not delayed by site weather.
	- Labour efficiency: Less site labour needed.
	- Durability: High-strength concrete and better curing improve lifespan.
	- Safety: less in-situ works
	- GFA concession
		- 10% floor are concession and corresponding site coverage concession
		- Support application for exceeding building height limits
- Cons
	- High initial cost: Moulds, transport, and craneage can be expensive.
	- Design rigidity: Limited flexibility once elements are cast.
	- Transport/logistics: Heavy elements require special handling.
	- Tolerances: Tight site coordination needed to ensure fit.
	- Storage space: Requires room for staging on-site.
- In-situ to MiC
	- Design repetitiveness
	- Double wall between MiC modules, and thicker enclosure walls to cater for rigging and hoisting during transportation and assembly on site - Increase loading and require foundation design enhancement
	- Simple facade finish, internal finish for easy rectification on site
	- Interfacing works
	- GFA recession
- Suitable for
	- Repetitive structures: E.g. residential towers, car parks, hotels.
	- Tight construction timelines: Need for speed and early occupation.
	- Sites with limited labour: Urban or remote areas.
	- Projects with high quality finish: Controlled factory conditions help.
	- Weather-sensitive sites: Where in-situ concreting is unreliable.
- Less suitable for
	- Highly bespoke or irregular designs: Precast lacks flexibility.
	- Restricted access sites: Difficult to transport and lift large units.
	- Projects with frequent design changes: Precast needs early freeze.
	- Small-scale works: Setup cost may not be justified.

### Prefabrication v in-situ *(2007 Q2.2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Characteristics of this development</mark>
	- Possible change to the layout
	- Non-typical storey heights related to the podium and top floors of the tower
	- Little repetition in guestroom layouts
	- Programme constraints
	- Site constraints
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Building elements using pre-cast</mark> / prefabrication construction
	- Precast facade
	- Precast slab, beam
	- Precast internal walls and partitions
	- Precast staircases
	- Prefabricated bathrooms
	- Prefabricated pipe ducts
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Planning and design consideration</mark>
	- There should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adequate number of repetitive units</mark> to justify for the use of precast elements
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Inflexibility in design</mark> as precast construction requires leas-time for statutory submission, approval and consent, shop drawings approval, manufacture and delivery
	- Once the precast operation is underway, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changes in layout may involve substantial abortive work</mark> - which could be costly and detrimental to the programme
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Design decisions have to be advanced</mark> to avoid abortive work. Activities like selection of sanitary fittings, co-ordination related to furniture / fixtures, etc. That take place after commencement of construction but much later in the programme in traditional construction would have to be advanced.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Programme consideration</mark> - overall precast less time
	- Extended construction time required in construction due to vertical transportation; also depends on the size of each panel, lifting capacity of the hoists, cranes available
	- Concrete cycle could be extended
	- Time required for going through the learning curve
	- Statutory submission for design approvals and consents for construction required in advance
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost consideration</mark>
	- There should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adequate number of repetitive units to justify cost effectiveness</mark> - such that factory equipment, moulds, standard detailing, etc. Could be utilized to its full capacity
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Likely changes to the design requirements</mark> e.g. layout, types of finishes, sanitary fittings, etc will have higher impact on prefabrication costs than traditional construction
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Higher premium in providing site facilities</mark> e.g. hoists, cranes, delivery cost, etc.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Technical consideration</mark>
	- From the logistic and site planning perspective, precast construction requires a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">large amount of working space</mark> on site for unloading, hoisting, storage, maneuvering 機動 of the unit
	- If the site is located along <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">busy roads</mark>, the delivery and hoisting of the precast units may only be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">possible during the night</mark>, hence increasing the cost
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Site constraints</mark> should be taken into account in the site planning
	- Finishes could be integrated into the precast panel during factory production - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduces the amount of wet trades on site</mark>
	- Consideration given to expensive materials to be precast as this would increase the weight of the panels and making <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lifting operation difficult</mark>; or may involve higher risk in breakage during transportation
	- Enhance <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">quality control</mark> in factory production
	- Difficult to achieve weathertightness. Due consideration should be given to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">joint details between precast units</mark> - once constructed, it will be difficult to rectify
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Other consideration</mark>
	- Precast construction provides <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">GFA exemption for high rise development</mark> - there could be a substantial gain in floor area
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green construction</mark> - help to enhance the corporate image of the developer

## Modular Integrated Construction (MiC)

- MiC
	- Free-standing volumetric modules (with finishes, fixtures, fittings, etc.)
	- Manufactured off-site
	- Transported to site for assembly
- Difficulty
	- Precast factory capacity
	- Factory / Contractor / worker's experience of MiC
	- Site storage area
	- Site constraints and road access constraints
	- Transportation vehicle restriction
		- Modular flat sub-divided to suit 2.5m width limit for transportation
		- ![Pasted image 20250708171421|500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/Pasted%20image%2020250708171421.png)
	- Lifting and installation
	- Dimensional tolerance control for multi-face connection
	- Simple fittings and finishes, and touch-up required

### Problems and issues of MiC *(2019 D1Q2)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Design feasibility</mark>
	- Economy of scale
		- Volumn / extent of work which can be modularized
		- Degree of repetition possible to maximize the economy of scale
	- Demarcation lines between MiC and in-situ construction to ensure intergrity without abortive work
	- Structural integrity, waterproofing, jointing and grouting work between modules or components
	- Compliance with statutory requirements on design. Time to obtain approval and consent or exemption
	- Flexibility to change
		- Limited room for design changes after the commencement of off-site fabrication
		- Possibility to freeze design early enought to call for MiC tenders
		- Likelihood to change design during construction
		- Possibiliites and measures to accommodate sight on-site adjustments to the modules
	- Limitaiton to the sizes and weights of modules due to logistic issues
	- Possibility of repair and replacement in case of serious defects after construction
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Design expertise</mark>
	- Knowledge of design consultants in MiC
	- Engagement of specialist knowing MiC
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractor and manufacturers</mark>
	- Availability of competent contractors and module manufacturers
	- Early in involvement of contractors and module manufacturers to obtaint their knowledge - for deisgn stage only and for full implementation, transition arrangement
	- Choice between open systems permitting many manufacturers or limitation to a few or one - accountability, freedom to choose, competition, etc.
	- Different roles of consultants and contractors in design stage and construction stage
	- Duplication of contractor's design team and employer's design / design checking team
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Logistics</mark>
	- Location of off-site fabrication yards. Suitability of transport from yards to site
	- Suitability of access roads to the site. Traffic congestion. Entry and exist waiting time
	- Availaibility of on-site ground level storage and working space fpr maneuvering of modules
	- Availability of space or heavy hoisting plant, hoisting routes, anchoring measures, etc.
	- Availability of nearby off-site storage after manufacture and pending installation
	- Challenges in synchronization 同步 of producation, logistics and site coordination
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Quality</mark>
	- Arrangement for quality control at the off-site yards - resident, travelling, intergrity
	- Training of workers especially on-site for installation of modules
	- Protection of the modules before and after installation
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Contractual</mark>
	- Payment terms with recognition of heavy upfront off-site costs
	- Insurance for off-site work
	- Ownership of off-site materials, and intellectual property rights
	- Extension of time and loss and expense clauses to take account of events arising off-site or not
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost</mark>
	- Construction cost of MiC versus in-situ construction after taking into consideration of the above - benefits of GFA exemption and Government funding for using MiC may also be taken into account
	- Measurement and pricing of the MiC modules - any breakdown of tender prices to facilitate future valuation of variations and how

### MiC adoption just before FDN tender (2024 D1Q2b)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">In the simplest term</mark>: while the adoption of MiC can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reduce the overall time to complete</mark> after the award of the contract including MiC, and the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">foundation period should generally be long enough to accommodate the tender documentation</mark>, submission and award for the contract including MiC, critical time will be required to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">change the already approved BD</mark> submission drawings affecting the foundation works to incorporate the impact of MiC in order to obtain re-approval. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">completion of the foundation works will still need to be deferred to match the re-approved drawings</mark>. All these may outweigh the possible time saving after awarding the contract including MiC.
- If MiC is adopted for the typical domestic floors, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">approved GBP, foundation plans and structural framing plans will have to be completely revised</mark> and resubmitted for approval. These drawings will likely have effect on the foundation design due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">different loading</mark> and possibly different column and wall layout.
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">two-week period left for issuance of foundation works tender documents will not be enough to incorporate the changes</mark> to the foundation design. If the foundation tenders are still invited based on the approved plans, there will be post contract changes to the foundation design, leading to complications similar to those described under A above.
- The tender drawings and specification incorporating the idea of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MiC should be prepared</mark> before they can be issued for calling for the tenders including MiC. The time required should generally be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">able to be accommodated during the foundation period</mark>.
- However, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">BD submission drawings incorporating MiC should be approved in good time so that the foundation works to be completed for the Building Department's inspection</mark> can match the approved BD submission drawings, otherwise, the foundation works will be rejected. Approval of major BD amendment submission will take <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2 months</mark>.
- Recommendation
	- To reduce the chances of deferring the foundation works and causing abortive work, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">possible additional loading and varied column and wall layout should be determined and reflected in the foundation design</mark> as early as possible, and then such fixed criteria should be imposed as constraints in the tenders including MiC.
	- It is a good idea to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">adopt MiC design already approved by BD</mark> because it will shorten the time to design and obtain statutory approvals, provided it is usable for this project.
- Bonus: the design of the concrete MiC modules for over 5000 residential units has to be limited to a few types for maximising the advantages of repetitiveness and economies of scale for enhancing efficiency and hence <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cost effectiveness</mark>
- Bonus: MiC normally involves repetitive double walls between MiC modules, and thicker enclosure walls to cater for rigging and hoisting during transportation and assembly on site. This will increase pile <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">loading</mark> and hence require foundation design revision.
- Bonus: Use of MiC provides <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">10% floor area concession</mark> and the corresponding site coverage concession as well as supports applications for exceeding building height limits due to increase in floor area caused by the adoption of MiC
