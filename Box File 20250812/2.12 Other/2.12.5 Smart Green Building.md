## Building Certification System

- Building Environmental Assessment Method (BEAM) Plus
- Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
- Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) 

## BEAM Plus

- Hong Kongâ€™s green building rating system
- The HKGBC (Hong Kong Green Building Council) is the certification body, with BEAM Society Limited undertaking the assessment process. 
- Application
	- New building
		- BEAM Plus New Building Version 2.0
	- Existing building
- Scoring
	- Platinum > Gold > Silver > Bronze

## GFA Exemption for Green Features

- Balconies, communal sky gardens, and wider common corridors

## Case Study

### PV panel drawbacks and risks *(2020 D1Q2)*

- High capital costs
- Insufficient amount of sunlight due to obstructions by nearby structures
- Insufficient space or improper configuration or orientation of space on roof. Taking up space on roof which may be used for other commercial purposes
- The amount of electricity generated by PV panels is only a small fraction of the total demand. Additional costs of an alternate power source or power back-up system may be incurred to ensure the overall power supply
- Shorter life span than normal electrical supply equipment. More renewals / replacements over the building life
- PV panels are prone to damage by inclement weather
- PV panels contain toxic materials which may cause environmental impact during disposal

### Fresh water cooling to seawater cooling *(2020 D1Q2)*

- Addition
	- Seawater intake pipes from pump house to site; pump fittings - valves, sensors, etc.
	- Seawater discharge pipes from site to discharge point; pipe fittings - valves, sensors, etc.
	- Signal control wiring and terminals between pump house and site
	- Works in connection with the installation of pipe and control wiring, e.g. utilities survey, excavation, pipe jacking or other method of installation, underground pits and chambers, hoardings, fencing, traffic diversion, settlement and environmental monitoring
	- Upgrading of existing seawater pumps and control in pump house if the existing provisions are not sufficient
	- Upgrading of existing filtration plant, chemical dosing system, electrical system and other pumping accessories if the existing provisions are not sufficient
	- Civil / structural works for potential expansion or modification of pump house to accommodate new equipment
	- Programme implication due to the lead time required for statutory submission and approval before the general building plan approval
	- Land lease premium implications
	- Programme implications due to the time required for statutory submission, approval and consent during construction, the time required to carry out the additional items, and the possible risks of delays beyond controls
- Substitutions
	- Differences in substructure designs to accommodate the pipe entering and leaving
	- Differences in pipework, pie fittings, pipe trenches, pipe ducts, building services within site up to the chiller plant
	- Differences between the equipment for the two systems, e.g. omission of cooling tower
	- Differences in architectural layout with potential repositioning of chiller plant room
	- Life expectancy and life cycle cost difference between the two systems
