### Show flat for public before completion (2004 Q4Aiv)

- The site is still under possession by MC, introducing the public into the site prior completion will need <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">MC's agreement</mark>, unless the same arrangement has already been stipulated in the contract
- The site is still a construction site, and further consideration should be given to any requirement for a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">temporary occupation permit</mark> for those areas to be opened to public. This will include related issues such as:
	- The dedicated and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">protected access</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Means of escape</mark> (which may be different from those for the project upon completion)
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Fire protection</mark>
	- Effective means of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">separation from the rest</mark> of the construction site etc.
- The introduction of the public will cause <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">disruption</mark> to MC's progress of the remaining work (including disruption to access, extra protection, possible stoppage of work during opening period, etc.), thereby giving an excuse to MC for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">EOT</mark>
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Extra protection and enhancement works</mark> for marketing purposes (including possibly addition of sales office on site)
- E will need to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">take possession</mark> of the show flats and possibly the whole 23rd floor to facilitate such opening, by trigger clause 18 partial possession by Employer. Upon doing so, E will have to consider the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insurance of the portion taken in his possession</mark> through his own Property All Risk Insurance and TPI.
- C should be asked to draw the attention of his <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CAR insurer </mark>of such increase risk and to obtain an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">endorsement</mark> from the insurer to such effect

## Control on Time, Cost & Quality
### E measures to reduce project time and limitations *(2003 Q 1.2)*

- Planning
	- Reduce number of storeys of buildings with corresponding increase in footprint size or number of buildings
		- Lower sale prices for lowered floors
	- Demolish by explosion
		- Difficult to obtain Gov approval
- Design
	- Use piling system which can maximize permissible noise restricted working hours
	- Use standard / systematic / typical / repetitive design to reduce drafting and construction time
		- Lower sale prices due to monotonous design
	- Use uniform and modular member sizes to reduce drafting and construction times
		- Possible over-sizing of some elements
	- Use higher grade concrete / concrete wit shorter curing period to reduce construction time
	- Use pre-fabricated / re-finished components to reduce construction time
		- Possible longer time and more intensive effort for design and detailing
	- Use steel structure to reduce construction time
		- Possible higher costs
	- Use pre-stressing for transfer plates
	- Avoid use of construction elements which may attract separate critical BD approval and testing, e.g. curtian wall, metal cladding
	- Use proven design to reduce testing and approval time
- Tendering arrangement
	- Package contracts suitably to allow overlapping of design, tendering and construction
	- Tender for and demolish existing buildings in phases to allow for earlier commencement of work on portion of the Site
	- Use design and build / turnkey contracts to reduce the pre-tender design time
	- Use remeasurement contract to reduce the tender documentation time
	- Select NSC earlier to reduce the chance of late nomination and to enable their requirements be incorporated into MC tender documents or programmes
- Construction arrangement
	- Require contractors to use plant extensively
	- Require contractors to use proven and new plant to avoid breakdown
		- Higher costs
	- Require contractors to use more number of plant
		- Higher costs
	- Require construction of tower core in advance of podium structure
		- More construction joints
	- Require construction of the podium structure top down after advanced construction of transfer plate for tower core
		- More construction joints
- Other
	- Squeeze time for all activities so far as possible
		- Acceleration and overtime costs

### E method to ensure time *(2019 D1Q3)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Design</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reduce possible variaitons</mark> by incorporating as full a possible the Employer's wishes in the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Tender Documents</mark>
	- Reduce possible variations by <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">reviewing the adequacy and consistency of the drawings and specification</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Submit to Gov dept for approval</mark> as early as possible <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">during design stage</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Shorten the design period by deferring the detailed design of non-critical</mark> and non-signficant items to the post contract stage, if the potential extra costs so incurred can be afforded
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Procurement</mark>
	- Call for the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">foundation works tender first</mark> without waiting for the detailed design of superstructure works to complete
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Exclude work not essential</mark> for school opening
	- Make work not essential for school opening as <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">optional items</mark> which may be omitted with no claim for profit if there is no enough time left do the work, and with stipulation that the omission can be taken into account in EOT assessment
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Shorten the contract period</mark> to give buffer for unavoidable delays with or without extension of time entitlement
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Delete ground for EOT for inclement weather</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Act proactively</mark> and promptly to resolve post contract problems
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Give incentive</mark> for early completion

### Reduce cost by Contractor w/o compromising quality and safety *(2003 Q 1.3)*

- Labour
	- Employ skilful labour to reduce abortive work
	- Import cheap labour so far as legal
- Materials
	- Exercise better control on supply quantities of materials
	- Exercise better control on wastage
	- Re-cycle re-usable waste
	- Sort out and sell valuable waste
- Plant
	- Keep the minimum number of plant for the minimum duration
	- Assess and maintain proper balance between plant and labour
	- Use more efficient plant
- Sub-letting
	- Invite bigger number of tenderers for sub-contracts and supply contracts
	- Sub-let more directly to the last tier of sub-contractors to reduce the profit in the intermediate tiers
	- Squeeze sub-contract prices
	- Agree better payment terms with sub-contractors in exchange for lower prices
	- Maintain good track record of prompt payments to sub-contractors in exchange for lower prices
	- Sub-let good sub-contractors and suppliers to reduce conflicts and problems during construction
- Management
	- Review tender drawings to identify discrepancy and inform Architect
	- Identify and resolve earlier design or buildability problems 
	- Serve notice of problems in construction regarding EOT, variation in time
	- Inspect and identify defects earlier
	- Keep a more competent supervisory team to reduce idling, double handling, abortive work
	- Co-ordinate better amongst all trades to reduce conflicts
- Financial
	- Make more frequent payments to help cash flow
	- Assess payments promptly and quickly
	- Resist / avoid variations which may aggravate the work or cause financial burden upon the Contractor
	- Encourage variation to increase quantities of items well priced
	- Chase for prompt, fair and reasonable assessment of time and cost claims
	- Claim rigorously
	- Keep and submit better records and documentation to enhance success in claims
	- Make value engineering or cost saving proposal

### MC catch up delay & improve quality *(2021 D2Q3)*

- Cath up delay 
	- Re-sequence works, change sequential works to parallel
	- Early start of some works
	- Overtime work
	- Deploy more labour and resource
	- Subcontract parts to others
	- Use advanced building technology
	- Improve communication among teams
	- Prioritize critical tasks
- Improve quality
	- Enhance quality control measures
	- Strengthen process management
	- Set up site quality inspection team, enhance monitoring
	- Regular training
	- Use good quality material, good workmanship labour / subcontractor

### Comment of Project Programme *(2006 Q2A)*

- Usual error
	- Short / long period allowance
	- Missing activities
	- Wrong sequence of activities
	- Start too early before precedent critical activities
	- Start too late with no lapse of time
- Example
	- Site investigation works are to yield underground information to enable the Engineer to design the foundation system and for submission to the statutory authorities (BD) to support the Engineer's foundation proposal. As such, the site investigation works <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">need to be tendered earlier and completed as soon as possible</mark> such that the information is available in time for the preparation of the design and submission
	- A two weeks programme for preparation of tender documentation is considered too <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">aggressive</mark>
	- Tendering out the whole works (foundation + superstructure) before BD approval may run <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">the risk of not capturing any additional requirements from BD</mark> in the tender. As such, tender addendum will be necessary. It would even be worse if the tender return is scheduled before the approval
	- The issuance of the tenders should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">after the finalization of the detailed design</mark> such that all of the detailed design will be incorporated into the tender documentation
	- There is no reason why steel fabrication starts after completion of the foundation works. Understandably, steel fabrication takes place <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">off site</mark> and requires considerable lead time, and should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">started as soon as possible</mark> and in time for other critical activities such as the lift delivery
	- Lift delivery should also be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">arranged earlier</mark> to be in-line with the completion of the structure and lift machine room for lift installation, and not be left until the completion of the structure
	- A realistic lift fabrication and delivery <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">period would be around 6-7 months</mark>, after preparation and submission of shop drawings by the Contractor and approval by the consultants
	- A 90 day lift installation for 2 lifts with only 3 stops would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">too long</mark>

### Programme not follow A's comment (2017 D2Q4a)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Justification to show anticipated completion date beyond the extended date for completion</mark>
	- It is the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">responsibility of the Contractor to regularly update the master programme</mark> to reflect the current status of the progress of the works under <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SFBC cl.3.2(1)</mark>
	- A <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">realistic programme</mark> should serve as a better <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">tool to monitor progress and ascertain delays</mark>
	- Contractor has the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sole right to plan the works as he likes</mark>
	- Provided that Contractor has reflected the true progress of the works with due consideration of possible means to complete the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">balance of the works regularly and diligently</mark> during the remaining contract period, the Architect cannot insist on the Contractor to submit a programme with anticipated completion date set earlier than the current completion date
	- The Contractor is therefore justified and in fact obliged to do so
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reasons for not comply with the Architect's request</mark>
	- If the delay is already <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">beyond recovery</mark>, showing the extended date as the anticipated completion date would need to compress or advance many activities <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unrealistically</mark>. This may have the adverse effect of missing all the planned days for the unrealistic activities. The Contractor will then face serious complaints of slow progress.
	- Showing earlier completion may mean <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">acceptance of the decision of no EOT</mark>
	- Showing earlier completion would <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">need acceleration to achieve</mark>
	- If earlier completion is eventually achieved, it would be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">difficult to prove the existence of prior delay needing EOT</mark>
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Reasons for not updating programmes</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Some Contractors only update programmes when there is EOT</mark> but EOT is usually not readily granted. Keeping the original programme unchanged can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">put pressure upon all sub-contractors</mark> to work according to the original programme so as to catch up delays especially when the delays do not have or are unlikely to have EOT.
	- This can also put <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">pressure upon the Architect</mark> to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">issue information or give comments and approval earlier</mark> so that the prospect of catching up culpable delays as well as claiming excusable delays due to Architect's late information, comments and approvals can be increased
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Employer's right</mark>
	- The obligation of the Contractor under the Contract to carry out and complete the works on or before the current completion date <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">will not be diminished or relieved</mark> no matter whether the Contractor updates the programme or not, with or without the Architect's comment (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">cl.2.2</mark>)

### Measures to control the Contractor's failure to submit programmes (2024 D1Q3)

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Measures to control the Contractor's failure to submit programmes</mark>
	- Require tenderers to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">price</mark> for the preparation and submission of the master programme and its updates against a set of detailed quantities with descriptions of the scope and type of the programmes and the times for submission, which amounts shall be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">payable in interim payments</mark> and final payments only if the relevant submissions have been made. It should not be after the approval of the relevant submission because the submissions may happen before the payment valuation date while the approval may happen afterwards.
		- The quantities may be fixed or provisional. In case of EOT, the additional quantities shall be entitled to payment.
		- Such method does not guarantee good quality programmes.
		- It may also have a set of quantities related to the approval by the Architect, but this may be problematic leading to much less payment if the programmes are poor or the Architect is over-demanding or has constant changes.
	- Another method if to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">make a percentage deduction</mark> to the current payment valuation if the Architect certifies that the quantities or quality of the programmes submitted after the last payment valuation is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not satisfactory</mark>. It should be stated whether and when such deduction will be released in the future. If the progress of the works is satisfactory or the Contractor has discharged his delay damages eventually, it would appear that such kind of deduction which may be more than the cost of the Contractor to submit the programmes in a satisfactory manner should be <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">released to the Contractor</mark>.
		- Architect's certification of non-satisfaction may be challenged by the Contractor leading to tension in the on-going running of the project
	- Another method is to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">engage dedicated programme planner jointly approved</mark> by Contractor and Architect but paid out of the Contract Sum to prepare the programmes considering the ideas of the Contractor and the comments of the Architect.
		- This is not usually adopted because this requires full disclosure of the issues and hidden strategy of Contractor, and collaboration amongst all parties

### Enhance cooperation *(2015 D2Q1)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Making the Works Contracts more partnering friendly</mark>
	- Attitude and mindset
		- It may be specified to have a partnering workshop at the beginning of the Works Contract for all key project team members to get to know each other, align their objectives, and understand the need to adopt a partnering mindset.
		- All people must work with mutual trust and respect in a collaborative manner for the best value of the project as a whole. They should move away from adversarial attitude.
		- Partnering workshops should also be conducted during the course of the Works Contract to review achievement and re-align with each other.
		- Commitment at all levels with strong support by the top level is very important
	- Objectives
		- It may be specified to have a partnering charter or agreement drafted and agreed by all parties involved to document the common objectives and an agreement to collaborate to achieve those common objectives
		- Partnering is about serving the interests of both contract parties or all parties involved in the Works Contract. The tender documents can only specify the objectives of the Employer and the Management Contractor. Chances should be given to the Works Contractor to express his objectives so that all parties can collaborate to achieve his objectives also. The consultant teams may also wish their objectives to be achieved.
		- The partnering charter may be drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop.
		- The objectives may be about the final product, such as good quality, on time, within respective budgets, minimum resources, no fatal accidents, few public complaints, better than expected, added value.
		- The objectives may also be about the process, such as planning ahead, identifying problems in advance, exchanging knowledge, warning proactively, adopting best practice, adopting proven practice, reducing wastes, simplifying tasks, cutting red-tape, improving buildability, finding better alternatives, resolving quickly, rectifying immediately, etc.
		- The objectives may also be about the attitude, such as co-operative, honest, frank, trusting, trustworthy, teamwork, empathic, sharing, no blame, no cheating, fair, wins for all, etc.
		- The partnering charter may have quantifiable key performance indicators.
	- Action plan
		- It may be specified to have an action plan drawn up to document the issues, concerns and risks identified in advance, and the parties and time to resolve them, in order to achieve the partnering objectives.
		- The action plan is usually drawn up at the partnering start-up workshop, and monitored and updated regularly
		- The action plan may be integrated with risk and safety management action plans
	- Monitoring
		- It may be specified to have a champion team comprising high level representatives of the Employer, Management Contractor, Works Contractor and Consultants to meet regularly to monitor the progress of the actin plan, rate mutual performance, resolve issues delayed by the lower level of staff, etc.
		- Contractual procedures may be specified to deal with problems through an "early warning" system with notices, meetings, time limits on a "without prejudice" basis. However, better results would be achieved if these are not put forward unilaterally as contractual procedures but are established and agreed by all parties through early joint discussions,
	- Resolution
		- It may be specified to have an issue resolution mechanism or matrix to identify who should be involved in resolving which kinds of problems, the time durations to resolve or, in case of failure to resolve, submit to higher authority for resolution to avoid delay in problem solving.
		- The involvement of an independent third party adviser to facilitate dispute avoidance and resolution throughout the partnering process would also be an advantage particularly in case of contractual deadlock.
	- Risk allocation
		- It is important to allocate risks to the party best placed to control and bear the risks and to ensure provisions relating to payment terms, grounds for EOT and loss and expenses are in line with the principle of fair risks allocation.
		- While the contract terms must be observed when implementing partnering, putting harsh terms and burden all on the Works Contractor is not serving the interest of the Works Contractor and it would be difficult to expect the Works Contractor to work in a partnering spirit.
		- Arrangement such as cost-plus payment will be most welcome by the Works Contractor but this may affect the Employer's cost control. However, if a partnering spirit is strongly kept with genuine effort to control the costs without extravagancies or reserving buffers for negotiation, the costs spent may as well be the most economical.
	- Incentive
		- It may be specified to have an incentive scheme to award the Works Contractor if he can achieve certain partnering key performance indicators, come below a target cost, finish before a certain date, etc.
		- Some projects also adopt a scheme to award the Consultants as well for their contribution to partnering success.
	- Value engineering
		- It may be specified that the Works Contractor is encouraged to suggest proposals to enhance the value of the project by increasing its functions, benefits and worth, and reducing the resources required.
		- The suggestion can be formulated by a value engineering stud by the Works Contractor himself or jointly with other project team members.
		- Successful achievement of the proposals may lead to incentive awards.
	- De-briefing
		- It may be specified to have a debriefing meeting after the completion of the works to review the failures and successes, and to show appreciation. Partnering is about long term relationship. It would be good that all people involved can learn the lessons, get commendations, and look for future collaboration.

## Technology
### IT tools for project management

- Benefits
	- The system provides a single platform for communication amongst various parties, and the QS can readily keep in touch with the project development
	- One-source for information storage and retrieved, eliminating different reference and increasing efficiency in information handling
	- Operate in real-time, thereby facilitating communication with overseas
	- Enhance readiness of information for respective QS of different roles to perform their respective functions, e.g. consultant QS can have first hand programme information to advise Employer to update cash flow projections
	- Facilitates multi-project handling through single platform, thereby enables quick analysis and information sharing, and provides a basis for building up cost information library
- Drawbacks
	- Intensive training of various parties is required
	- Continuous monitoring of the system is required
	- Ownership of the server and information therein, legal clearance
	- Careful setting of security levels for each participant is essential to avoid sensitive information being known to unintended parties

### Aluminium formwork to replace timber *(2014 D2Q4)*

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Time</mark>
	- Long <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">lead time</mark> is required for manufacturing aluminium formwork in factory
	- Floor layout and structural <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">design must be finalized in advance</mark> for preparation of aluminium formwork design
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Openings</mark> for building services works must also be coordinated well in advance before the manufacture of aluminium formwork
	- Time required for going through the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"learning curve"</mark> for using aluminium formwork for the first few floors may be longer when compared with using traditional timber formwork
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">On-site installation of aluminium formwork is quicker</mark> because of lighter weight if not much in-situ adaptation is required
	- During <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">rainy days</mark>, carpenters would stop the use of woodworking saw machine so as to prevent electric shock. Unlike the erection of traditional timber formwork, the erection of aluminium formwork does not involve the use of woodworking saw machine. Metal formwork erectors can still work in light rain. The possibility of keeping the scheduled days of concreting cycle is higher.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Cost</mark>
	- Aluminium formwork materials <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">newly manufactured</mark> and delivered to site cost much more than traditional timber formwork
	- On the other hand, aluminium formwork <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">used on other sites before</mark> and easily adapted for a new project due to similarity will cost much less
	- Normal <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">daily wages of metal formwork erectors are much lower</mark> than those of carpenter
	- Timber formwork uses <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">skillful carpenters</mark> which are highly <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">insufficient in the construction market</mark>. Aluminium formwork requires less skill on site and uses metal formwork erectors who are easier to employ without jacking up the wages for a particular project. It can help secure the stability of the cost of the formwork.
	- Whether it is cheaper per unit area of formwork to use aluminium formwork is very much dependent on the extent of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">repetitive</mark> use of aluminium formwork with the least amount of in-situ adaptation, cutting and waste. Logically, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">non-typical floors would not be suitable</mark> for using aluminium formwork.
	- The cost benefits of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">saving in the overall construction time</mark> would be a major factor for consideration 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Restrictions and other merits</mark>
	- Once aluminium formwork has been manufactured, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">changes in layout or design</mark> may involve extensive abortive work, which may in turn cause extensive time and cost implications.
	- Some contractors may <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not be familiar</mark> with the design and erection of aluminium formwork, the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">requirement for using aluminium formwork may discourage their submission of tenders</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Few trade sub-contractors are experienced</mark> in aluminium formwork than in timber formwork
	- As building services works are required to be coordinated before the manufacture of aluminium formwork, this would probably <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">encourage the Employer and design team to freeze the design and coordinat</mark>e the structural works and building services works much in advance when compared with using traditional timber formwork. 
	- Theoretically, aluminium formwork can <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">enhance better quality of concrete surfaces</mark> after removal of the formwork. The extent of making good work at step joints and concrete surfaces should be smaller when compared with using traditional timber formwork.
	- It is a kind of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">green construction</mark>. It can be a merit to reduce construction waste of unused timber formwork. Aluminium formwork can be reused on other sites or resold for recycled use.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Recommendations</mark>
	- Because of the need to give time for the design and manufacture of aluminium formwork, if the piling and foundations are under a previous piling contract, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">unlikely that there would be enough time</mark> for the basement to use aluminium formwork.
	- Because aluminium formwork needs higher degree of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">standardization and repetition</mark> to be cost and time effective, it is <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">not suitable</mark> to use aluminium formwork for basement, podium, refuge floor, duplex floors, and generator room.
	- Subject to other considerations, in view of the cost effectiveness and the programming certainty of aluminium formwork on the typical floors, those 38-sotrey <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">typical floors</mark> should be suitable, provided it is unlikely to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">change the floor design</mark> in response to market conditions. The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">floor layout and design should be finalized well in advance</mark> so as to avoid abortive work. The likelihood of change in response to market conditions should also be low, otherwise, the time and cost would become much higher than those when using timber formwork.

## Safety and Environment
### Pay for Safety and Environment Scheme (2006 Q3C)

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">How can PFSES help the industry</mark>
	- To <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">remove site safety from the realm of competitive bidding</mark>. Traditionally site safety obligations are governed by law, and such obligations are transferred to contractors through the all-embracing Preliminaries.
