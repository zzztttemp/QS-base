### Contractor's Practice

- Check if SOP provisions are included in the contract before signing.
- Familiarise the project team with SOP procedures and statutory timeframes.
- Submit clear, well-supported Payment Claims with accurate references and substantiation.

- Serve Payment Claims as per SOP format

- Record site progress, delays, instructions, and correspondence in real time.
- If full payment is not received, review the Payment Response and assess if adjudication is justified.
- Initiate adjudication within the allowed time if dispute arises.
- Nominate a trained internal SOP contact person or engage an external claims consultant.

- Prepare for adjudication with complete documentation and clear chronology of events.

### Contractor's Exercising Right to Suspend

- Confirm the contract includes SOP provisions allowing suspension for non-payment.
- Ensure paying party failed to pay admitted amount or adjudicated amount in full or before the required date
- Serve a formal Notice of Intention to Suspend Work (as per contract / SOP clause).
- Observe any required notice period (e.g. 5 days after notice before suspension).
- Verify that all procedural steps and timelines under the SOP clause have been followed.
- Ensure the suspension affects only relevant parts of the work, avoid total demobilisation if not justified.
- Maintain clear site records before and during the suspension period (e.g. site condition, notices, manpower logs).
- Notify insurance and relevant authorities if suspension affects statutory obligations.
- Prepare for adjudication if Employer disputes the suspension.
- Keep communication professional and well-documented to avoid claims of abandonment or breach.
- Resume work promptly once payment is received or as required under the SOP clause.
- Review contractual consequences (e.g. entitlement to EOT, cost claims during suspension).
